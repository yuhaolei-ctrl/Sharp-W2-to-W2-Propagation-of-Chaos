# The elementary Itô integral as a continuous local martingale (Summit B / B3)

The genuinely new result here is **pathwise (sample-path) regularity** — the
first such result in the Itô tower, which so far is an `L²`/in-measure theory.
For a **continuous** Brownian motion `B` (the standard pathwise setting —
`IsPreBrownianReal` fixes only the finite-dimensional laws, and Degenne's
Kolmogorov–Chentsov machinery produces a continuous version):

* `itoSimpleProcess_pathContinuous` — for each `ω`, the path `t ↦ (V ● B)_t ω` is
  continuous. Via the explicit truncated increment-sum
  `(V ● B)_t ω = ∑_p V(p)ω·(B_{p.2∧t}ω − B_{p.1∧t}ω)` (`itoSimpleProcess_apply`),
  each summand is the continuous Brownian path `B(·)ω` composed with the
  continuous clamp `t ↦ min p.i t`, and a finite sum of continuous functions is
  continuous.

The continuity then unlocks the **localization** entry point — the bridge that
places the integral inside Degenne's local-martingale framework:

* `itoSimpleProcess_isLocalMartingale` — `(V ● B)` is a continuous **local
  martingale** (`IsLocalMartingale`). It is already a genuine `L²` martingale
  (`itoSimpleProcess_isMartingale`, B1a); with the continuous (hence càdlàg)
  paths this is exactly the hypothesis of Degenne's `Martingale.IsLocalMartingale`,
  so the integral lands in the upstream local-martingale class — the gateway
  object for the localized stochastic calculus (SDEs, Lévy's characterization,
  dynamic Girsanov).

## Coherence

Pure consumption: the martingale property is B1a, the path continuity is a
finite sum of continuous clamped Brownian increments, and the local-martingale
packaging is Degenne's sorry-free `Martingale.IsLocalMartingale`
(`Locally.of_prop` along the constant localizing sequence). Nothing is reproved.

## Scope

Honest scope: the **elementary** (simple-integrand) integral, under a continuous
Brownian motion. For these `L²`-bounded simple integrands the integral is in fact
a true martingale, so the local-martingale statement is the canonical *framing*
that connects to the localized theory; the genuinely new content here is the
pathwise continuity. The general-integrand pathwise local martingale needs a
continuous modification of the `L²` limit and remains the next gate.
