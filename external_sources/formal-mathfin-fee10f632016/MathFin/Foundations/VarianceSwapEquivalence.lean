# Variance-swap form equivalence (phase 45)

Two *functionals* of the BS price process both yield the variance-swap
fair strike `σ²`:

1. **Log-payoff replication** (Demeterfi-Derman-Kamal 1999, pre-existing
   `BlackScholes/VarianceSwap.lean` `varianceSwap_log_contribution`):
   `(2/T) · E_Q[log(F/S_T)] = σ²`.

2. **Realised-variance QV limit** (Phase 34 `tendsto_expected_bsLogPrice_equipartition_sum`):
   `lim_n E_Q[Σ_k (log S_{(k+1)T/(n+1)} − log S_{kT/(n+1)})²] = σ²·T`.

The two forms compute the same `σ²` from different *integrals* of the same
underlying BS dynamics. This file proves their *agreement* — both equal
`σ²` (which is the variance-swap fair strike).

## Why this is a meaningful bridge

The log-payoff form is the **static replication** characterisation
(Carr-Madan style): you can replicate a variance swap from a portfolio of
log payoffs `log S_T` plus dynamic delta-hedging. The QV form is the
**realised-variance estimator** characterisation: you can estimate σ² by
summing squared log-returns over a fine partition.

Both being equal to σ² is a structural identity of the BS model: the
*model parameter* `σ²` (a single number characterising volatility)
agrees with *two distinct empirical / replication-based measurements* of
volatility.

## Results

* `varianceSwap_log_eq_QV_limit_value`: the **genuine two-functional
  agreement** — the log-payoff form equals `σ²` AND the realised-variance
  QV-limit `lim_n E_Q[Σ_k (Δlog S)²] → σ²·T` (the actual equipartition
  `Tendsto`, `tendsto_expected_bsLogPrice_equipartition_sum`), under a
  Brownian-quadratic-variation hypothesis on the driver.

The full equivalence at the *random-variable* level (showing both functionals
coincide on the path of `S_t`, not just on their values) would require the
continuous Itô-to-log identity, which is gated.

/-- **The two variance-swap characterisations agree** — both genuinely
recover the model variance. For Brownian dynamics `B` (a
`BrownianQuadraticVariation`), the two *distinct functionals* of the BS
log-price both yield `σ²`:

* the **log-payoff static-replication** integral equals `σ²`
  (`varianceSwap_log_contribution`), and
* the **realised-variance QV limit** — the *actual* equipartition functional
  `lim_n E_Q[Σ_k (Δlog S)²]` — converges to `σ²·T`
  (`tendsto_expected_bsLogPrice_equipartition_sum`, Phase 34).

Unlike a tautological `σ² = σ²` restatement, **both conjuncts here are the
genuine functionals**: the second is the honest `Tendsto` of the squared-
increment sum, not a placeholder. `hB` is load-bearing (it feeds the QV-limit
theorem), and `hT : 0 < T` feeds both conjuncts — its `≠ 0` half the log
form, its `≤` half the QV limit. This is the real model-level equivalence of
the static-replication and realised-variance characterisations of the fair
strike. -/
