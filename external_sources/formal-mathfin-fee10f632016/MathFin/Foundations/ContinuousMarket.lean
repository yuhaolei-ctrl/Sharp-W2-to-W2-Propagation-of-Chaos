# Continuous-time market vocabulary: `IsEMM`, simple strategies, no-arbitrage

A **model-agnostic** frame for the continuous-time first fundamental theorem of asset
pricing (FTAP), parametric over a finite-dimensional real inner-product-space-valued
discounted price process `S : ℝ≥0 → Ω → F`. The Black–Scholes model (`ContinuousFTAP.lean`)
instantiates it at `F = ℝ`; a multi-asset model would instantiate at `F = Fin n → ℝ`.

* `IsEMM S Q` — `Q` is an equivalent martingale measure for `S`: `Q ≈ P` (mutual absolute
  continuity) and `S` is a `Q`-martingale w.r.t. the filtration `𝓕`.
* `SimpleStrategy 𝓕 F` — a piecewise-constant, predictable, bounded trading strategy:
  finitely many trading dates `time : Fin (N+1) → ℝ≥0` and `𝓕`-measurable bounded holdings
  `hold : Fin N → Ω → F` between consecutive dates.
* `SimpleStrategy.gains` — the discounted terminal gains of a simple strategy against `S`.
* `NoArbitrageSimple S` — no simple strategy's gains are `P`-a.s. nonnegative and strictly
  positive on a `P`-non-null set.
* `increment_integrable`, `increment_integral_zero` — a bounded predictable weight against a
  `Q`-martingale increment is `Q`-integrable with zero `Q`-mean. Public because the
  pricing-measure argument of `PricingMeasureL2Density` is built out of exactly these, summed
  over a simple process's bands.

## Scope: meaning-1 (operational) vs. meaning-2 (Delbaen–Schachermayer) FTAP

This file builds **meaning 1**: an EMM for a *given* process, restricted to the honest,
economically transparent class of *simple* (piecewise-constant) strategies. It deliberately
does **not** build meaning 2, the Delbaen–Schachermayer theorem (`NFLVR ⟺ ∃ EMM` for a
general locally-bounded semimartingale, admissible strategies over a continuum of trading
times, and the general stochastic integral `∫ φ dS`). Absent by design:

* general **admissible** strategies (not just piecewise-constant) and the general stochastic
  integral `∫ φ dS` against a semimartingale;
* **NFLVR** (no free lunch with vanishing risk) and its distinction from plain no-arbitrage;
* the **converse** direction `NoArbitrageSimple S → ∃ Q, IsEMM S Q`, and closedness of the
  set of claims super-replicable from zero wealth (the Kreps–Yan / Hahn–Banach core DS needs).

`IsEMM` here is stated *on a process* `S`, exactly the object Delbaen–Schachermayer's theorem
would produce — so this frame is a strict sub-object of the DS one, and extending it to
meaning 2 is additive (new strategy class + new theorem), not a rewrite.

One such extension already exists. `Foundations/MarketCompleteness` states replication,
superreplication duality and uniqueness of the pricing measure over the **Itô-integrable
predictable** integrands rather than `SimpleStrategy`. That widening is forced by the
mathematics, not chosen: the hedge martingale representation returns is a general predictable
process, and a general `L²` claim is not the terminal value of any piecewise-constant holding,
so a completeness statement over `SimpleStrategy` would have no witnesses. `SimpleStrategy`
remains the right class *here*, where the whole point is that the forward no-arbitrage
conclusion needs no stochastic integration at all — a finite sum of predictable increments. The
two classes coexist; neither file changes the other, and `IsEMM` is shared unchanged.

/-- **Forward continuous first FTAP: an equivalent martingale measure precludes simple-strategy
arbitrage.** If `Q` is an EMM for the discounted price `S`, then no simple strategy has gains that
are `P`-a.s. nonnegative and strictly positive on a `P`-non-null set. Each increment integrates to
`0` under `Q` (`increment_integral_zero`), so the whole gain does; transporting the `P`-nonnegativity
to `Q` (via `Q ≈ P`), the zero-mean nonnegative gain vanishes `Q`-a.s.
(`ae_zero_of_nonneg_of_integral_zero`), hence `P`-a.s. -/
