# Static spread no-arbitrage relations (bull-call, butterfly)

Two static no-arbitrage payoff inequalities at expiry, both expressing
*structural properties of the call payoff in the strike*:

* **Bull-call spread** `max(S − K₂, 0) ≤ max(S − K₁, 0)` for `K₁ ≤ K₂`:
  the payoff `K ↦ max(S − K, 0)` is *antitone* in `K`.
* **Butterfly spread** `0 ≤ max(S − K₁, 0) − 2 · max(S − (K₁+K₃)/2, 0) +
  max(S − K₃, 0)`: the payoff is *convex* in `K`, so its discrete
  second-difference at the midpoint is non-negative.

These are not two independent theorems; they are the *antitone* and *convex*
faces of `K ↦ max(S − K, 0)`. Both structural facts are recorded in
`StrikeConvexity.lean` (`antitone_call_payoff` and `convexOn_call_payoff`).

The same convexity, applied infinitesimally rather than discretely, yields
non-negativity of the second `K`-derivative of the European call price —
i.e. the Breeden-Litzenberger implied PDF.

/-- **Butterfly spread payoff non-negativity**: for `K₂ = (K₁ + K₃)/2`,
`0 ≤ max(S − K₁, 0) − 2 · max(S − (K₁+K₃)/2, 0) + max(S − K₃, 0)`.

The discrete second-difference of the convex function `K ↦ max(S − K, 0)` at
the midpoint of `K₁` and `K₃` is non-negative: this is Jensen's inequality
`f((K₁+K₃)/2) ≤ (f(K₁) + f(K₃))/2`, multiplied by 2 and rearranged. The
hypothesis `K₁ ≤ K₃` is retained for API stability but is not needed for
the inequality. -/
