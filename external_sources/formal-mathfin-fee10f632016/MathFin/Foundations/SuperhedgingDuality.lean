# The fundamental superhedging bound

In a finite-state market with excess-return matrix `z : Fin M → Fin N → ℝ` (`M` assets, `N` states),
every equivalent martingale measure prices a claim at most its super-replication cost:
`∑ qₙ Yₙ ≤ x` for any EMM `q` and any cost-`x` portfolio `θ` that dominates `Y` in every state. Hence
the EMM prices of a claim lie below its superhedging price — the dual side of the no-arbitrage pricing
interval, and the pricing-side companion of the coherent-risk representation.

The full superhedging *duality* (superhedging price *equals* the supremum of EMM prices) is the reverse,
separation-based direction; it requires closedness of the super-replication cone `{W | ∃ θ, W ≤ θ·z}`.
Farkas itself is *not* the blocker — Mathlib ships `ProperCone.hyperplane_separation` and
`hyperplane_separation_point` (`Analysis/Convex/Cone/Dual.lean`). What is missing at this pin is
closedness of a finitely generated cone: there is no `Polyhedron`/`Polyhedral` development and no
`PointedCone.isClosed_span_of_finite`. That one lemma is the whole remaining cost.

* `MathFin.emm_le_superReplication` — the fundamental bound
