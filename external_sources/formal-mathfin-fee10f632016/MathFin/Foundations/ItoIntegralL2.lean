# The L²-adapted Itô isometry, anchored on Degenne's `SimpleProcess`

This file establishes the **Itô isometry for adapted simple processes** — the substantive
analytic content of the L² Itô integral — built on Degenne's
`BrownianMotion.StochasticIntegral` objects (the maximally-coherent choice). The Itô integral
*operator* itself (the CLM `itoIntegralCLM_T`) is assembled from this isometry in
`ItoIntegralCLM.lean`; the *discrete* isometry core is `ItoIsometryAdapted.lean`. The cornerstone
is that the cross-terms vanish by the **weak Markov property** (`rect_increment_pairing`,
from `ItoIsometryAdapted.lean`), *not* by deterministic covariance — the precise distinction
between the Itô integral (random adapted integrands) and the Wiener integral (deterministic
integrands, `WienerIntegralL2.lean`). Degenne's `SimpleProcess` allows *overlapping*
intervals, which is exactly why `rect_increment_pairing` is the right tool.

## Results

* `natFiltration` — the natural Brownian filtration `𝓕ᴮ_t = σ(B_u : u ≤ t)`.
* `adaptedAt_of_measurable_natural` — the bridge from `natural B`-measurability (which
  `SimpleProcess.value` carries) to `ItoIsometryAdapted.AdaptedAt` (factoring through the
  past process), via Doob–Dynkin (`Measurable.exists_eq_measurable_comp`). This is what
  lets the `AdaptedAt`-stated isometry core consume Degenne's `SimpleProcess`.
* `elemIntegrand` — the elementary integrand `Z·1_{(a,b]}`, and `rectTerm` its instance at a
  simple process's band; `uncurry_ae_eq_sum_rectTerm_of_ae_fst_ne_zero` decomposes a simple
  process into its bands for **any** measure charging the time origin nothing, which is what
  lets the bracket-weighted spaces of the integral-against-a-martingale reuse it.
* `itoSimple` / `itoSimple_apply` — the elementary Itô integral
  `(V ● B)_⊤ = ∑ₚ V(p)·(B_{p.2}−B_{p.1})` (Degenne's `SimpleProcess.integral` against
  multiplication, at the terminal time `⊤`).
* `memLp_itoSimple` / `itoSimpleLp` — it lies in `L²(μ)`.
* `itoSimple_sq_integral` / `itoSimpleLp_norm_sq` — **the Itô isometry**:
  `‖itoSimpleLp V‖² = ∫ (itoSimple V)² dμ = Σ_{p,q} E[V(p)·V(q)] · vol((p]∩(q])`.

## Toward the continuous integral

The continuous extension to a CLM `L2Predictable ν μ →L[ℝ] Lp ℝ 2 μ` is built on top of the
isometry by L²-completion: the time measure `ν` (Lebesgue on `ℝ≥0`, below), the embedding of
simple processes into the predictable `L²`, density of those embeddings (via
`generateFrom_eq_predictable`), and `LinearMap.extendOfNorm`. This is the foundation of a
continuous-time Itô-*calculus* layer (Itô's lemma, SDEs). The full resume-plan is in
`docs/ito-integral-clm-deferred.md`.

/-- The **elementary Itô integral** of a simple process `V` against Brownian motion
`B`, evaluated at the terminal time: `(V ● B)_⊤ = ∑ₚ V(p)·(B_{p.2} − B_{p.1})`,
the increment sum with nothing truncated.

Until the 2026-07-27 pin this *was* Degenne's `SimpleProcess.integral … ⊤`: his
elementary integral was indexed by `WithTop ι`, so `⊤` named the untruncated
value and `SimpleProcess.integral_top` unfolded it to this sum. At the new pin
`integral : ι → Ω → G` — the index dropped `WithTop`, `integral_top` is
commented out upstream, and with `ι = ℝ≥0` there is no `⊤` to evaluate at. The
untruncated value is therefore no longer *expressible* as an evaluation of
`integral`, and is taken as the definition here.

Nothing downstream is weakened: every consumer goes through `itoSimple_apply`
(now definitional), and the process-level integral `itoSimpleProcess` still
consumes `SimpleProcess.integral` directly, at a genuine time `t : ℝ≥0`.
Restoring the consumption relation — `itoSimple = integral … t` for any `t`
dominating `V`'s finite support — is a follow-up recorded in
`docs/upstream-consumption-review-2026-07-27.md`. -/

where `vol((p.1,p.2] ∩ (q.1,q.2]) = max 0 (min p.2 q.2 − max p.1 q.1)`. The square of the
increment sum expands into a double sum whose every term collapses by
`rect_increment_pairing` — the genuinely-stochastic content (cross terms vanish by the
weak Markov property, diagonal terms give the deterministic overlap). The right-hand side
is exactly `‖V‖²` in the predictable `L²` space, so this is the Itô isometry. -/

/-! ### The time measure `ν` — Lebesgue on `ℝ≥0`

The CLM domain is `L2Predictable ν μ = Lp ℝ 2 ((ν.prod μ).trim 𝓕.predictable_le_prod)`
(Degenne's `L2M`). The interval overlap appearing in the isometry **is** Lebesgue length
(it comes from `E[(Bₜ−Bₛ)²] = t−s`), so `ν` must be Lebesgue measure on the time axis `ℝ≥0`.
Since `ℝ≥0` carries no canonical `volume`, we take the comap of `volume` along the (closed,
hence measurable) embedding `ℝ≥0 ↪ ℝ`. -/

/-! ### Embedding simple processes into the predictable `L²`

The uncurried simple process `uncurry V : ℝ≥0 × Ω → ℝ` is, up to a `timeMeasure.prod μ`-null
set (the time-fibre `{⊥}`), the finite sum over `V.value.support` of **rectangle terms**
`𝟙_{(p.1,p.2]}(t) · V(p)(ω)`. Each rectangle term is `L²` in the product (its time-support is
a finite-measure interval and `V` is bounded), so `uncurry V ∈ L²(timeMeasure.prod μ)`; being
predictable-strongly-measurable, it descends to `L2Predictable timeMeasure μ`. -/

/-- **The elementary integrand** `Z·1_{(a,b]}`: a bounded weight on `Ω` switched on over a
time band. It is the atom of every simple process (`rectTerm` below is this at the band `p`
with weight `V.value p`) and, in the tower above, the integrand on which a stochastic integral
is pinned to its Riemann–Stieltjes value. It depends on neither the driver nor the
filtration. -/
