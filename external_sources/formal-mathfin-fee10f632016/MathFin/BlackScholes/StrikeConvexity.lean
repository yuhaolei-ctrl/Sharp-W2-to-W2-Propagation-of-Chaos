# Strike-direction convexity at every scale

The European call satisfies *the same* convexity-in-`K` fact at three
different scales of resolution:

1. **Payoff level**, `K ↦ max(S − K, 0)`. Convex because the positive
   part of an affine function is convex (`ConvexOn.sup` on `(S − ·)` and
   `0`).
2. **Finite-state price level**, `K ↦ Σ q_i · max(S_i − K, 0)`. Convex
   because non-negative linear combinations of convex functions are convex
   (`ConvexPricingFunctional.callPrice_finiteState_convexOn_K`).
3. **Continuous BS price level**, `K ↦ bsV K r σ S τ`. Convex on `(0, ∞)`
   because its second `K`-derivative is non-negative
   (`hasDerivAt_bsV_KK` + `convexOn_of_deriv2_nonneg'`).

The three scales are not three theorems; they are one principle realised at
three different levels of integration. This file packages all three so the
hierarchy is visible.

## Downstream consequences (one principle, many faces)

* **Bull spread** `V(K₁) ≥ V(K₂)` for `K₁ ≤ K₂` — `Antitone`-payoff after
  pricing-functional preservation of monotonicity.
* **Butterfly non-negativity at payoff** (`butterfly_payoff_nonneg`) —
  convex-payoff second-difference inequality.
* **Butterfly non-negativity at price** (`callPrice_finiteState_butterfly_nonneg`) —
  pricing functional preserves convexity, hence the same second-difference
  is non-negative at the price level.
* **Breeden-Litzenberger PDF positivity** (`lognormalTerminalPDF_nonneg`) —
  the infinitesimal manifestation of price-level convexity, by
  `bsV_strike_convexOn` below + `convexOn_iff_deriv2_nonneg`.

## Results

* `convexOn_sub_const_id`: `K ↦ a − K` is convex.
* `convexOn_call_payoff`: `K ↦ max(S − K, 0)` is convex in K (payoff level).
* `antitone_call_payoff`: `K ↦ max(S − K, 0)` is antitone in K.
* `bsV_strike_convexOn`: `K ↦ bsV K r σ S τ` is convex on `(0, ∞)`
  (continuous BS price level).

functions are simultaneously convex and concave; the inequality holds
with equality. -/

/-- **Call payoff is convex in the strike**: `K ↦ max(S − K, 0)` is convex.

This is the structural spine of static option-price no-arbitrage relations.
Butterfly non-negativity and Breeden-Litzenberger PDF positivity are
discrete and infinitesimal consequences (respectively) of this single fact,
after passing through risk-neutral expectation. -/

/-- **Call payoff is antitone in the strike**: higher strikes pay less.

Equivalent to monotonicity of `max(·, 0)` composed with `K ↦ S − K` (which
is itself antitone). The single-line consequence of monotonicity of `max`. -/

/-! ## The continuous-price face

Beyond the payoff (`convexOn_call_payoff`), the *price itself* is convex
in the strike. The proof is the second-derivative test:

* `hasDerivAt_bsV_K`: `∂_K bsV = −e^{-rτ} · Φ(d_2)` exists at every `K > 0`.
* `hasDerivAt_bsV_KK`: `∂²_K bsV = e^{-rτ} · ϕ(d_2) / (K σ √τ)` exists and
  is non-negative for every `K > 0`.

We feed these to Mathlib's `convexOn_of_deriv2_nonneg'`. The only delicate
step is identifying `deriv (fun K' ↦ bsV K' r σ S τ)` with the explicit
first derivative in a neighborhood of each interior point so the second
derivative inherits the closed form — handled below with
`HasDerivAt.congr_of_eventuallyEq`. -/

/-- **First-derivative identification on `(0, ∞)`**: the closed form for
`∂_K bsV` from `hasDerivAt_bsV_K` agrees with `deriv` on the whole positive
half-line. Used to bridge `hasDerivAt_bsV_KK` to a second-derivative
statement on `deriv` itself. -/

/-- **Local equality of derivatives on `(0, ∞)`**: in a neighbourhood of any
`K > 0`, `deriv (fun K' ↦ bsV K' r σ S τ)` agrees with the explicit closed
form, so derivative facts about the closed form transfer to `deriv`. -/

/-- **BS call price is convex in the strike on `(0, ∞)`** — the continuous-
price face of the K-convexity principle.

This is the second-derivative test applied to BS: at every `K > 0`,
`∂²_K bsV = e^{-rτ} · ϕ(d_2)/(K σ √τ) ≥ 0`. The hypotheses of
`convexOn_of_deriv2_nonneg'` are the differentiability of `bsV` and of its
first derivative on `Ioi 0`, both of which we have in closed form from
`hasDerivAt_bsV_K` and `hasDerivAt_bsV_KK`. -/

strike-convexity: `bsP = bsV + (K·e^{-rτ} − S)` differs from `bsV` by an affine

second-derivative apparatus of `PutStrikeConvexity` is not needed. -/
