# Forward and futures pricing under the BS lognormal hypothesis

Under `BSCallHyp` (risk-neutral lognormal model), the risk-neutral
expectation of the terminal asset price equals the no-arbitrage forward
price:

    E_Q[S_T] = S_0 · e^{rT}.

This is the classical no-arbitrage relation `F = S_0 · e^{rT}` derived as
a direct consequence of the Gaussian MGF identity. The discounted asset
price is automatically a Q-martingale (at maturity):

    E_Q[e^{-rT} · S_T] = S_0.

No Itô calculus is required — pure Gaussian integration.

## Interpretation as a no-arbitrage price

A long forward contract pays `S_T − F` at maturity. The **forward price**
`F` is conventionally defined as the unique value making the contract
worth zero at inception. Under any risk-neutral measure `Q`, the zero-value
condition is

    0 = E_Q[e^{-rT}(S_T − F)] = e^{-rT}(E_Q[S_T] − F),

so `F = E_Q[S_T]`. Combined with `expected_terminal_eq_forward`, this gives
`F = S_0 · e^{rT}`.

/-! ### Risk-neutral expectation of terminal asset price -/

/-- **No-arbitrage forward price**: under `BSCallHyp`,
    `E_Q[S_T] = S_0 · e^{rT}`.

This is the risk-neutral expectation of the terminal asset price, which is
the no-arbitrage forward price `F` for delivery at time `T`. Derivation:
HasLaw transfer to standard normal + `integral_exp_mul_gaussianPDFReal_univ`
(Gaussian MGF) + BS algebra `(r - σ²/2)T + σ²T/2 = rT`. -/
