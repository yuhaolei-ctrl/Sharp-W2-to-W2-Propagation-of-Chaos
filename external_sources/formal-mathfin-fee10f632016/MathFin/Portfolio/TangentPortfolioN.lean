# N-asset tangent portfolio — re-export

The N-asset tangent FOC has been folded into
`Portfolio/TangentPortfolio.lean`, where it sits next to the two-asset
closed form (of which it is the natural generalisation).

The namespace `MathFin` exposes `IsTangentPortfolioN` and
`isTangent_of_proportional` through the transitive import.
