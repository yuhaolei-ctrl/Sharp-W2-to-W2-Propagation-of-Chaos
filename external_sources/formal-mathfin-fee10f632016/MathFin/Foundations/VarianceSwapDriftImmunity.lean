# Variance-swap fair strike is drift-immune: L² realized variance of GBM

A variance swap pays the realized variance of log-returns against a fixed
strike. Quoting the fair strike as `σ²` presupposes that the realized
variance of the price path identifies `σ²` — *and does so regardless of the
drift*, since the physical drift is unknown and the risk-neutral drift is a
modelling choice. This file proves exactly that, in the strong (mean-square)
sense:

for a geometric Brownian motion price
`S_t = S₀ · exp((μd − σ²/2)·t + σ·B_t)` with **arbitrary** drift parameter
`μd`, the realized variance of log-returns along the uniform `n`-partition
of `[0, T]` converges in `L²` to `σ²·T`:

  `E[(∑_k (log S_{t_{k+1}} − log S_{t_k})² − σ²T)²] → 0`.

The drift does not appear in the limit: realized variance is a
quadratic-variation functional, and `Foundations/ItoProcessQV.lean` shows the
(Lipschitz) drift contributes `O(1/n)` to it. Financially: the
variance-swap fair strike can be quoted as `σ²` without taking a stance on
the drift — the estimator the swap settles on concentrates at `σ²T` under
the physical measure and the risk-neutral measure alike.

## Relation to the existing variance-swap chain

* `Foundations/VarianceSwapLimit.lean` (phase 34) proves the
  *expectation-level* limit `E[Σ (Δ log S)²] → σ²T` for the risk-neutral BS
  log-price (drift pinned to `r − σ²/2`). This file strengthens it twice:
  convergence of the estimator itself in `L²` (concentration, not just
  unbiasedness in the limit), and for every drift.
* `BlackScholes/VarianceSwap.lean` proves the Demeterfi–Derman–Kamal
  log-payoff replication `(2/T)·E[log(F/S_T)] = σ²` — the static-hedge leg.
  Together: the floating leg the swap *measures* (here) and the option
  portfolio that *replicates* its strike (there) identify the same `σ²`.

## Main result

* `tendsto_realizedVariance_gbm_L2` — realized variance of GBM log-returns
  `→ σ²·T` in `L²`, uniformly in the drift parameter.

/-- **Variance-swap drift immunity.** For a GBM price
`S_t = S₀ · exp((μd − σ²/2)t + σ B_t)` with arbitrary drift `μd`, the
realized variance of log-returns along the uniform partition of `[0, T]`
converges in mean-square to `σ²·T`. The drift is absent from the limit:
the fair variance strike is a quadratic-variation functional, immune to
the (physical vs. risk-neutral) drift. -/
