/-! # Strict separation of the continuation slope from the exercise slope

Stock-price convexity bounds the derivative below by the secant from the
exercise boundary. Strict price/payoff separation makes that bound strictly
greater than -1 in stock coordinates, hence greater than -exp(x) in log spot.

## Result

Public entry points include `canonicalPrice_spatial_deriv_gt_exercise`.
