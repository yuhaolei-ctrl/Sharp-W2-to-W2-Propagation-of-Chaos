# Black-Litterman one-dimensional Bayesian update

In the Black-Litterman framework, expected returns `μ` are updated from a
prior `μ ~ N(π, τΣ)` by combining with views `P μ = Q + ε`, `ε ~ N(0, Ω)`. The
posterior is a precision-weighted Gaussian. In one dimension (single asset,
single view directly on `μ`) this reduces to the classical
Gaussian-conjugate update:

  `posterior_mean = (s1sq π + s0sq Q) / (s0sq + s1sq)`,
  `posterior_var  = s0sq s1sq / (s0sq + s1sq)`,

where `s0sq` is the prior variance and `s1sq` the view's observation noise. The
result is the harmonic mean of variances; equivalently, the precision
(`1/σ²`) is additive. Both extreme limits behave correctly:

* `s1sq → 0` (perfect view): posterior_mean → `Q`,
* `s1sq → ∞` (uninformative view): posterior_mean → `π`.

Results:

* `posteriorMean1d`: standard formula.
* `posteriorVariance1d`: harmonic combination.
* `blackLitterman_mean_eq_precision_weighted`: equivalence of the
  precision-weighted form with the symmetric form.
* `blackLitterman_var_eq_inv_sum_precision`: equivalence with the
  inverse-sum-of-precisions form.
