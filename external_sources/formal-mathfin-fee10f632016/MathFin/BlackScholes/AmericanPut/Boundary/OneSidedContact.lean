# Spatial test functions at exercise contact

A stationary maximum on the exercise side suffices for a second-derivative
bound on a smooth test function. The price itself need not be twice
differentiable across the free boundary.

## Result

Public entry points include `second_deriv_nonpos_at_left_stationary_max`, `spatial_test_at_boundary`.

/-- At a local maximum of test minus price, the test has the payoff slope
and at most the payoff curvature at exercise contact. After subtracting the
contact value, this is a test touching the price from below. Only the test
function has a second derivative across the boundary. -/
