/-! # Actual-price comparison with locally smooth upper supports

The comparator may have a jump in its second derivative. At each potential
positive maximum it suffices to have a smooth majorant touching the comparator.
The actual price is smooth there because the comparator dominates the payoff.

## Result

Public entry points include `canonicalPrice_no_positive_supported_max`, `canonicalPrice_le_of_upper_supports`.
