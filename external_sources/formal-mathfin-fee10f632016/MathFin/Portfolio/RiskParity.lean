# Risk parity portfolio (two-asset closed form)

A risk-parity portfolio sets each asset's *marginal contribution to variance*
equal across assets. For two assets with volatilities `σ₁, σ₂` and
correlation `ρ`, the closed-form risk-parity weights (under the budget
constraint `w₁ + w₂ = 1`) are independent of `ρ`:

  `w₁^RP = σ₂ / (σ₁ + σ₂)`,
  `w₂^RP = σ₁ / (σ₁ + σ₂)`.

The independence from correlation is the surprising feature: only the
relative volatilities matter for equal-risk allocation.

Result:

* `riskParityWeightTwo`: definition `σ₂ / (σ₁ + σ₂)`.
* `risk_parity_equal_contribution`: at the RP weights, the two assets'
  contributions to portfolio variance are equal.
