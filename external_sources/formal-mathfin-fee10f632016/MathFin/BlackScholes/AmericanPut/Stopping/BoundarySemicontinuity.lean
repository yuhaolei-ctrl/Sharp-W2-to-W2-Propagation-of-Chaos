/-! # One-sided continuity of the actual financial exercise threshold

Continuity of the price in maturity makes the threshold upper semicontinuous.
Together with its monotonicity this proves continuity from shorter maturities.
Continuity from longer maturities is not asserted by this argument.

## Result

Public entry points include `threshold_upperSemicontinuous`, `threshold_continuousWithinAt_left`, `brownianExerciseBoundary_upperSemicontinuous`, `brownianUsualExerciseBoundary_upperSemicontinuous`.
