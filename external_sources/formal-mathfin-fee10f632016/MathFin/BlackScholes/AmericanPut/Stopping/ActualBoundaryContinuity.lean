/-! # Continuity of the actual exercise boundary

The slice-forcing argument excludes downward jumps. Together with the already
proved upper semicontinuity and monotonicity, it gives full continuity, including
expiry. No smooth-fit or free-boundary differentiability assumption is used.

## Result

Public entry points include `canonicalStockBoundary_exists_later_gt`, `canonicalStockBoundary_continuousAt`, `canonicalStockBoundary_continuousOn`, `canonicalLogBoundary_continuousAt`.
