# Blueprint spine — post-hoc `@[blueprint]` tagging

Declares the blueprint nodes of the deductive spine (`docs/blueprint.md`) by
tagging existing declarations **post hoc** with LeanArchitect's
`attribute [blueprint …]`. The tags live HERE, in a leaf module nothing
imports, so the proof modules are untouched: their sources keep their
verification-ledger hashes (zero restale), and the spine's dependency edges
are *inferred from the proof terms* (`Architect.collectUsed` — a transitive
walk that stops at tagged constants, so edges pass through untagged helpers).
The graph in `docs/blueprint.md` is generated ground truth, never hand-drawn.

Regenerate after touching the spine:

  `lake build MathFin.Blueprint && lake exe blueprint_export MathFin.Blueprint`
  then `python3 tools/blueprint_render.py` (see that file's header).

Node prose lives in `(statement := …)`: one honest sentence per node — what
the mathematics says, with deferrals named, never papered over.
