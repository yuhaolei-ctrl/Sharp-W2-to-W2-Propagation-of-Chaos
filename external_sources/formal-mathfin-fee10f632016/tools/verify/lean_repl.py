"""Persistent Lean-interact REPL daemon.

Listens on TCP 7878 (inside the container; mapped to host by the
``lean-repl`` service in ``docker/docker-compose.yml``). Each connection
sends a single Lean code blob (typically a full ``.lean`` file's content);
the daemon elaborates it through the lean-interact server and returns a JSON
response with errors / warnings / sorry count.

The Lean server is initialized ONCE at daemon startup. The expensive bit
(loading Mathlib + BrownianMotion + MathFin oleans, ~5 min on a cold
cache) is paid once per daemon lifetime; subsequent checks just elaborate
the new file against the loaded environment (~5-30 sec).

This converts the authoring loop from "edit → docker compose run --rm → wait
5-15 min → parse errors" to "edit → nc localhost 7878 → 5-30 sec → parse
errors", which is the LSP-equivalent for an LLM author who edits via a Tool
rather than via a graphical editor.

Usage from host:
    # one-time per session: start the daemon (waits ~5min for Mathlib load)
    docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d lean-repl
    docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml logs -f lean-repl  # watch for READY

    # per iteration: send a file, read the JSON response
    cat MathFin/Foo.lean | nc localhost 7878
    # or via the wrapper:
    ./scripts/lean-check.sh MathFin/Foo.lean

    # tear down
    docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down lean-repl

The daemon serializes requests through ``LeanBackend._lock`` since the
underlying Lean server is not thread-safe. Multiple concurrent connections
queue.
