# Glosten-Milgrom adverse-selection bid-ask spread

Glosten and Milgrom (1985) derive the bid-ask spread from adverse selection
alone. A fraction `p` of arriving traders know a binary asset value
`V ∈ {V_L, V_H}`; the rest trade at random. A competitive market maker quotes

  `ask = E[V | buy]`,   `bid = E[V | sell]`,

updating by Bayes on the direction of the order. The spread is what is left.

Two modelling conventions, both visible in the statements. The sell event is
`Bᶜ`: every arriving trader either buys or sells, so there is no no-trade
outcome, and `bid = E[V | Bᶜ]`. And the quotes are *posited* to be those
conditional expectations — Glosten-Milgrom's derivation of them from a
competitive market maker's zero expected profit is not formalized here.

The four stages below are marked by section headers. The fourth is what makes
the other three a single theorem rather than three separate ones:
`cond_toReal_eq` is Bayes pushed through `.toReal`, and that is what identifies
the model's posterior `μ[H | B]` with the real function `postBuy` stage 3
reasons about. `toReal` sends `∞ ↦ 0` and `x/0 ↦ 0`, so every conversion below
carries its `≠ ∞` side condition.

The `ℝ≥0∞` stages state the trade probabilities *additively* — `2·P = 1 + p`,
`2·P + p = 1` — so that no step ever forms a difference in a type where
subtraction truncates. The textbook form does follow from the additive one
(`ENNReal.eq_sub_of_add_eq`, given `p ≠ ∞`); it is the *proofs*, not the
statements, that the additive form buys.

## The hypothesis `0 < θ < 1`

The usual statement of the result omits it. It is not a technical convenience,
and the two endpoints fail for different reasons.

With `p < 1` a degenerate prior leaves nothing to be adversely selected: both
posteriors coincide, the spread is exactly `0`, and `ask - bid > 0` is false.

A degenerate prior with `p = 1` is worse, in two ways both machine-checked here.
One of the two trade events becomes null, and `quote_eq_zero_of_null` shows what
`cond` then returns: not a bad price but the zero measure, whose integral is `0`.
And `spread_junk_at_corner` evaluates the closed form at `θ = 1, p = 1` — it
returns the *entire* `V_H - V_L`, the largest spread there could be, at the one
point where the true spread is `0`, because `0/0 = 0`. Nothing errors in either
case. Excluding the endpoints excludes both at once.

The derivation demands the hypothesis independently: `two_mul_cond_buy_high`
needs `μ H ≠ 0` and `two_mul_cond_buy_low_add` needs `μ Hᶜ ≠ 0`, so their
hypotheses cannot be jointly satisfied without `0 < θ < 1`.

A model satisfying all of them — so the theorem is not vacuous — is in
`MathFin.Execution.GlostenMilgromModel`.

## Results

* `two_mul_cond_buy_high`, `two_mul_cond_buy_low_add`: the trade probabilities,
  derived from the trader mix.
* `payoff`, `spread_eq`: the quotes as integrals, and the payoff cancelling.
* `postBuy`, `postSell`, `post_sub_post`: the posteriors and the closed form
  `4pθ(1-θ) / (1 - p²(2θ-1)²)`.
* `cond_toReal_eq`: Bayes in `ℝ` — the seam.
* `postBuy_eq`, `postSell_eq`: the model's posteriors *are* `postBuy`/`postSell`.
* `spread_pos_of_model`: `∫ V ∂μ[|buy] > ∫ V ∂μ[|sell]`, from the model's own
  primitives.
* `quote_eq_zero_of_null`, `spread_junk_at_corner`: what the excluded endpoints
  actually do — a quote that is not a quote, and a closed form returning the
  whole value range.

with `θ ≠ 0` from the high-value case, **the model itself forces `0 < θ < 1`** —
exactly the hypothesis the issue is missing. It is not an extra condition imposed

`cond` on a null set is the *zero measure*, so the "price" integrates to `0`

at `θ = 1, p = 1` every arriving trader buys, so `Bᶜ` is null and the "bid" is
not a bad price but no price at all. `p = 1` alone is harmless and is *not*
excluded — `spread_pos_of_model` derives `p ≤ 1` rather than assuming it, and at
`p = 1` with `0 < θ < 1` both trade events still carry positive mass. It is the
prior's endpoints that have to go. -/

/-- **Glosten–Milgrom: the spread is strictly positive.** The market maker's ask
and bid are `∫ V ∂μ[|buy]` and `∫ V ∂μ[|sell]`, and the first strictly exceeds
the second whenever `V_L < V_H`, `0 < p ≤ 1` **and `0 < θ < 1`**.

This is the issue's `## Acceptance criteria`, with the hypothesis it omits. The
chain is: Stage 1 derives the trade probabilities from the trader mix; Stage 4
converts them and applies Bayes to get the posteriors; Stage 2 turns the quotes
into those posteriors; Stage 3 supplies the strict inequality. -/
