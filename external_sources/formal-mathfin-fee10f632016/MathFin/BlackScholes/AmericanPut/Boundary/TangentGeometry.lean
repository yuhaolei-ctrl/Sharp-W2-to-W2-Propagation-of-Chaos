# Strict concave tangent geometry at positive times

Local negative curvature puts a smooth function strictly below its tangent on
both sides. This is a real-calculus theorem, independent of any parabolic or
financial assumptions.

## Result

Public entry points include `eventually_lt_tangent_of_second_deriv_neg`.
