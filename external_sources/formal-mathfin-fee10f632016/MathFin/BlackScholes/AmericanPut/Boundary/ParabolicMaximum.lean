# A weak parabolic maximum principle

This module proves, rather than assumes, the elementary maximum principle
needed in Steps 4 and 5. The terminal time is included. The moving left boundary
needs continuity, not a bounded velocity at expiry.

## Result

Public entry points include `second_deriv_nonpos_at_local_max`, `deriv_nonneg_at_left_max`, `movingStrip`, `movingStrip_isCompact`.
