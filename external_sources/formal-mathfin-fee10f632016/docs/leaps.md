# The leaps: deriving the risk-neutral measure and beyond

The static Black-Scholes world in this library is complete and axioms-clean,
but for a long time it rested on one *assumption*: `BSCallHyp` — "the driver
`Z` is standard normal under the risk-neutral measure `Q`" — was a hypothesis
that 14 pricing files took on faith. The 2026-05-23 "leaps" close that gap and
push past it. Each leap is foundation-certain and build-enforced
(`MathFin/AxiomAudit.lean`); none introduces a hypothesis-form theorem whose
substantive hypothesis is left undischarged.

This document is the narrative. For the per-theorem audit see
[`coverage.md`](coverage.md); for the bridge catalogue see
[`bridges.md`](bridges.md).

## Leap 1 — static Girsanov: the risk-neutral measure is *derived*

`MathFin/Foundations/GaussianGirsanov.lean`.

`BSCallHyp` is no longer an axiom. The risk-neutral measure `Q` is
*constructed* from the physical measure `P` by an explicit Radon-Nikodym
(Esscher) density, and the recentred driver is *proven* standard normal under
it. The deductive chain, bottom-up:

| Step | Theorem | Content |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `gaussian_esscher_pdf` | Completing the square: `exp(c·x − c²/2)·φ₀,₁(x) = φ_c,₁(x)`. |
| 2 | `gaussianReal_withDensity_esscher` | Measure level: tilting `N(0,1)` by the Esscher density gives exactly `N(c,1)` — mean shift `c`, variance fixed. The static (single-Gaussian) Girsanov theorem. |
| 3 | `map_withDensity_comp` | Pushforward commutes with a density factoring through the map: `(P.withDensity (g∘W)).map W = (P.map W).withDensity g`. Proved from `Measure.ext` + `setLIntegral_map`; **upstreamable to Mathlib**. |
| 4 | `hasLaw_esscher_tilt` | Girsanov for a random variable: if `W ~ N(0,1)` under `P`, then `W ~ N(c,1)` under `Q := P.withDensity(exp(c·W − c²/2))`. |
| 5 | `hasLaw_sub_const` | Recentring: `W − c ~ N(0,1)` under `Q`. |
| 6 | `esscherTilt_isProbabilityMeasure` | `Q` is a probability measure (the Esscher density is normalised). |
| 7 | **`BSCallHyp.exists_of_physical`** | **The capstone.** There exists a probability measure `Q` — the explicit Esscher tilt — under which `BSCallHyp` holds for the recentred driver. The risk-neutral hypothesis is now a *theorem*. |
| 8 | `bsTerminal_physical_eq_riskNeutral` | The conceptual heart: the Girsanov shift `c = (r − μ)·√T/σ` reprices the *same* asset with drift `μ → r`. `S_T` is invariant; only its drift changes. |

Economic reading: `c = −θ·√T` with market price of risk `θ = (μ−r)/σ`; the
recentred driver `W − c = W + θ√T` is the risk-neutral driver. This is the
slice of Girsanov tractable without the path-wise stochastic integral.

## Leap 2 — the genesis cascade: physical → EMM → pricing

`MathFin/Foundations/GaussianGirsanov.lean` (same file).

Two composites wire the Girsanov construction into the prior pricing
artifacts — making `GaussianGirsanov` load-bearing rather than a dead leaf:

- `discounted_terminal_eq_S0_of_physical` — the constructed `Q` is a *genuine
  equivalent martingale measure*: `E_Q[e^{−rT}·S_T] = S₀` (the discounted
  asset is a `Q`-martingale). This is the defining property of an EMM, so the
  Esscher construction yields a real risk-neutral measure, not merely one
  under which the driver is standard normal.
- `bs_call_formula_of_physical` — the full chain `physical → Girsanov → Q → BS
  closed form`.

These are **additive bridges**: the pricing files keep `BSCallHyp` as their
clean abstraction, and Girsanov sits above them (the same pattern as
`PricingFromBrownian` / `BSCallHypFromBrownian`). The pricing files are *not*
refactored to depend on Girsanov — that would invert the dependency graph.
The spine is `physical measure → Girsanov → Q → BSCallHyp → pricing`.

## Leap 3 — multivariate: Margrabe's exchange option

`MathFin/BlackScholes/ExchangeOption.lean`.

The first genuinely multivariate result. The exchange option pays
`max(S¹_T − S²_T, 0)`; its structural fact (Margrabe 1978) is that it depends
only on the ratio `S¹/S²`, lognormal at **effective volatility**
`σ² = σ₁² + σ₂² − 2ρσ₁σ₂`, so the two-asset problem collapses to a one-asset
Black-Scholes problem. It reuses the 1-D machinery rather than re-deriving —
the same structural-reduction discipline as `PowerCall`.

| Theorem | Content |
|---|---|
| `margrabe_variance_sub` | `Var[L₁ − L₂] = Var L₁ + Var L₂ − 2·cov(L₁,L₂)` via covariance bilinearity. First consumer of the covariance machinery shared with `Foundations/BivariateGaussian` — makes it load-bearing. |
| `margrabe_effective_variance` | Substituting `σ₁²T, σ₂²T, ρσ₁σ₂T` gives the effective variance `(σ₁²+σ₂²−2ρσ₁σ₂)·T`. |
| `exchange_payoff_eq_ratio` | `max(a−b,0) = b·max(a/b−1,0)` — the exchange payoff is `S²_T` times a vanilla call on the ratio. |
| `margrabe_eq_bsVGarman` | Margrabe **is** a `GarmanNormalForm` instance at `A=S¹₀, K=S²₀, DF=1`, effective vol `σ`. A multivariate option is the same formula `V = A·Φ(d₁) − K·DF·Φ(d₂)` as every BS-family price. |
| `margrabe_parity` | Exchange-option parity: `Margrabe(S¹,S²) − Margrabe(S²,S¹) = S¹ − S²` (the analog of put-call parity), via `Φ(x)+Φ(−x)=1`. |
| **`margrabe_price_via_call`** | **Price-level reduction.** In the `S²`-numeraire, the exchange option is `bs_call_formula` on the ratio: `S²₀·E_Q[max(R_T − 1, 0)] = margrabePrice`. |

The price-level result takes `BSCallHyp` for the *ratio* `R = S¹/S²` — exactly
the abstraction `bs_call_formula` takes for any underlying.

**Leap 3 grounding (done)** — `MathFin/BlackScholes/MargrabeGrounding.lean`.
That `BSCallHyp` for the ratio is now *derived*, the Margrabe-analog of leap 1:

| Theorem | Content |
|---|---|
| `normalizedSpread_hasLaw_std` | **Bivariate → univariate reduction.** For a jointly-gaussian pair `(W₁,W₂)` of standard drivers with correlation `ρ`, the normalized log-spread driver `(σ₁W₁ − σ₂W₂)/σ_eff` is `N(0,1)`: gaussianity is preserved under the linear map (`HasGaussianLaw.map_of_measurable`), and the variance is pinned to `1` by covariance bilinearity (`margrabe_effective_variance`) — making `Foundations/BivariateGaussian`'s machinery load-bearing. |
| **`margrabe_bsCallHyp_of_gaussian`** | **The capstone.** From the joint gaussian model there exists a probability measure `Q` (the explicit Esscher tilt — the `S²`-numeraire change) and a standard-normal driver under which `BSCallHyp` holds for the ratio at the effective vol. The two-asset grounding *reduces to* the one-asset Girsanov (`BSCallHyp.exists_of_physical`, leap 1) applied to the single effective driver — the gaussian-vector reduction is the only new ingredient. |

Composing `margrabe_bsCallHyp_of_gaussian` with `margrabe_price_via_call`
prices the exchange option with **no** assumed risk-neutral hypothesis.

## The honest abstraction boundary

Across leaps 1 and 3 there is one consistent, deliberately-drawn line: a
pricing hypothesis (`BSCallHyp`, or `BSCallHyp` for the ratio) may be taken as
a primitive at the level the whole library operates, and the *deepest*
grounding of that primitive from a Brownian motion / a joint model is a
distinct, harder result. Leap 1 is that grounding for the 1-D `BSCallHyp`;
the leap-3 grounding (`MargrabeGrounding.lean`) is the corresponding one for
the ratio's `BSCallHyp` — both are now *derived*, not assumed. The discipline
holds: no hypothesis-form theorem is committed unless its hypotheses are
discharged in the same arc or are the standard library-level pricing
primitive.

## Leap 4 — the adapted Itô isometry (done, discrete)

`MathFin/Foundations/ItoIsometryAdapted.lean`.

The Wiener integral (`Foundations/WienerIntegralL2.lean`) handles
*deterministic* integrands, where cross-terms vanish by the BM covariance.
That is **not** the Itô integral. Leap 4 builds the genuinely-stochastic
core: a **random, adapted** integrand `φ`, where the cross-terms vanish for a
deeper reason — the next increment `B_{t₁} − B_{t₀}` is *independent of the
past* `𝓕_{t₀}` (the weak Markov property `IsPreBrownian.indepFun_shift`) and
has mean zero.

The increment-independence this was long thought to wait on is **not** WIP:
it is `IsPreBrownian.hasIndepIncrements` and `IsPreBrownian.indepFun_shift`,
fully proven in Degenne's package. The deductive chain:

| Theorem | Content |
|---|---|
| `adapted_indepFun_increment` | An integrand adapted to `𝓕_{t₀}` is independent of the forward increment `B_{t₁} − B_{t₀}` (via `indepFun_shift`). |
| `integral_adapted_mul_increment` | **Martingale-difference property.** `E[φ·(B_{t₁}−B_{t₀})] = 0` for adapted `φ` — the reason the Itô integral is a martingale, and it holds for *random* `φ`. |
| `integral_adapted_sq_mul_increment_sq` | **Isometry kernel.** `E[φ²·(B_{t₁}−B_{t₀})²] = E[φ²]·(t₁−t₀)`. |
| `adaptedAt_eval`/`.mono`/`.mul`/`.sub` | The adaptedness algebra (the natural Brownian filtration `𝓕_{t₀}` as a closure), used to certify the cross-term factors are `𝓕_{tₖ}`-measurable. |
| **`ito_isometry_discrete`** | **The discrete Itô isometry.** `E[(Σₖ φₖ·ΔBₖ)²] = Σₖ E[φₖ²]·(t_{k+1}−t_k)` for adapted `L²` integrands. Diagonal = variance kernel; off-diagonal = 0 by the martingale-difference property. |
| **`ito_isometry_brownian_self`** | **The `∫₀ᵀ B dB` Riemann-sum isometry**, `E[(Σₖ B(tₖ)·ΔBₖ)²] = Σₖ tₖ·Δtₖ` — a fully-discharged instance (no remaining hypotheses beyond measurability + a monotone partition). |

All build-enforced axioms-clean (`MathFin/AxiomAudit.lean`).

## Leap 4, continuous — the bounded-horizon CLM, now consumed (2026-05-29)

The L²(adapted) Cauchy completion is **built**: `ItoIntegralCLM.itoIntegralCLM_T`
is the continuous Itô integral as a CLM `Lp 2 trim_T →L[ℝ] Lp 2 μ` with the
isometry `‖∫₀ᵀ f dB‖ = ‖f‖` (density via `simpleAssembly_T_denseRange`, the
orthogonal-complement → π-λ argument). Bounded horizon `[0,T]`; the unbounded-`ℝ≥0`
CLM (σ-finite predictable exhaustion) stays gated.

It now has its **first genuine consumer** (`Foundations/ItoIntegralBrownian.lean`,
`itoIntegralCLM_T_brownian`): `∫₀ᵀ B dB = ½(B_T² − B₀² − T)` as a real
`itoIntegralCLM_T` identity, bridging the abstract CLM to the concrete
quadratic-variation limit. The unbounded Gaussian integrand `s ↦ Bₛ` is realised
as the `trim_T`-limit of its clamp-truncated left-endpoint step processes — the
genuine construction of the Itô integral for an unbounded `L²` integrand.

Still open: the *general* Itô formula / path-wise SDE form and the time-indexed
martingale/isometry on `t ↦ (V●B)_t`, which would clear the remaining Itô-gated
`reduced_core`s in [`coverage.md`](coverage.md).

(The Margrabe `BSCallHyp`-grounding, previously gated here, is **done** — see
Leap 3 above, `MargrabeGrounding.lean`.)

## Leap 5 — martingale representation: the hedge is *derived* (2026-08-07)

`MathFin/Foundations/MartingaleRepresentation.lean`,
`MathFin/Foundations/MarketCompleteness.lean`.

Leap 4's continuous half built the Itô integral as an isometry `φ ↦ ∫₀ᵀ φ dB` from
the predictable `L²(dt⊗dμ)` integrands into `L²(μ)`. What that isometry does *not*
say is which claims it reaches. The binomial tower has replication and its uniqueness
because a finite tree can be solved backwards; in continuous time the library could
integrate a strategy it was handed, and had no theorem saying a strategy exists.
Leap 5 identifies the image exactly. `itoIntegralCLM_T` is onto the **centered
`𝓕ᴮ_T`-measurable** part of `L²(μ)`, so the hedge exists, is unique, and is produced
by the theorem rather than posited.

The route is not Malliavin calculus and not Clark–Ocone. Surjectivity of an isometry
onto a closed subspace is a *totality* statement about its range, and the two halves
come from separate modules:

| Theorem | Content |
|---|---|
| `BrownianCylinderGeneration.iSup_cylinderFiltration_eq_natFiltration` | The Brownian filtration is generated by the dyadic cylinder σ-algebras, `⨆ₙ cylinderSigma B T n = natFiltration`. Path continuity enters exactly once, turning `B qₙ → B s` along dyadic `qₙ → s` into measurability against the supremum. Bundled as a genuine `Filtration ℕ`, which is what Lévy's upward convergence theorem consumes. |
| `ItoIntegralLocality.coeFn_smulAdapted` | `𝓕_a`-linearity of the terminal integral: scaling a predictable integrand by an `𝓕_a`-measurable factor supported on `(a, T]` scales the integral. Proved by equalizing two continuous linear maps on the dense range of simple-process assemblies (`DenseRange.equalizer`). |
| `DoleansStepRepresentation.stepDoleans_sub_one_mem_range` | Every step-integrand Doléans exponential, minus one, is **inside** the range. The induction over the partition is where `𝓕_a`-linearity is spent. |
| `WienerExponentialTotality.eq_zero_of_orthogonal_stepDoleans` | The other half: an `L²(𝓕ᴮ_T)` variable orthogonal to all of them is zero. Abel summation reduces to a linear exponential, MGF analytic continuation settles it on each cylinder σ-algebra, and Lévy upward convergence lifts it to `𝓕ᴮ_T`. |
| **`itoIntegralCLM_T_surjective_onto_centered`** | **The capstone.** The Itô integrals together with the constants exhaust `lpMeas ℝ ℝ 𝓕ᴮ_T 2 μ`. A centered `𝓕ᴮ_T`-measurable `F` splits as `y + z` against the range (closed, being an isometry's image, hence orthogonally complemented); `z` inherits measurability and centering from `F`, so `∫ z·D = ∫ z·(D − 1) + ∫ z = 0` for every step Doléans `D`, and totality kills `z`. |
| `exists_itoIntegral_representation` | Terminal form, `∃!`: `F =ᵐ 𝔼[F] + ∫₀ᵀ φ dB`, uniqueness being injectivity of an isometry. |
| `itoIsometryEquiv` | The two bundled: a `LinearIsometryEquiv` from the predictable integrands onto `centeredBrownianL2`. |
| `martingale_representation` | Process form: every square-integrable martingale on the Brownian filtration is `M_t = M_0 + ∫₀ᵗ φ dB` (corpus `gir-thm-9.3.4`, flipped `reduced_core → full`). |

`𝔼[∫₀ᵀ φ dB] = 0` is proved, not assumed, one floor down as
`ItoIntegralProcessGeneral.integral_itoIntegralCLM_T`.

**The finance reading** (`MarketCompleteness.lean`): `exists_replicating_strategy`
says every square-integrable `𝓕ᴮ_T`-claim is the terminal wealth `𝔼_μ[H] + ∫₀ᵀ φ dB`
of a strategy, with a unique hedge, and `superReplication_eq_emm_price` says the least
initial wealth from which some strategy dominates `H` is that same `𝔼_μ[H]`. The
strategy class is the Itô-integrable predictable integrands, wider than
`ContinuousMarket.SimpleStrategy`; the widening is forced, since a general `L²` claim
is not the terminal value of any piecewise-constant holding.

**The abstraction boundary, drawn as deliberately as in leaps 1 and 3.**
`measure_eq_of_pricesGainsAtZero` proves uniqueness of the pricing measure on the
Brownian filtration *for measures that price the traded gains at zero*. That is not
the unconditional second FTAP, and it is worth being exact about why. The textbook
argument needs the replicating wealth to be a stochastic integral against the price
`S`, hence a martingale under every EMM. The wealth process martingale representation
builds is an integral against `B`, and `S` and `B` share only a filtration, so nothing
in `IsEMM S Q` makes `∫₀ᵀ φ dB` a `Q`-fair game. The fair-game step is therefore
hypothesised under its own name, `PricesGainsAtZero`: step (i) of the textbook proof
assumed, step (ii) proved. Two proved facts keep it honest rather than convenient —
`pricesGainsAtZero_self` (`μ` itself satisfies it, so nothing is vacuous) and
`pricesGainsAtZero_of_gains_martingale` (the textbook gains-martingale condition
implies it). The corollary `emm_unique_of_complete` consumes only the `isProb` and
`ac` fields of `IsEMM`. Closing the gap means the stochastic integral `∫ φ dS` against
a general price, whose absence `ContinuousMarket` already records as deliberate.

Only `complete ⟹ unique` is delivered. The converse needs the Jacod–Yor extreme-point
characterisation of the set of martingale measures and is out of scope, additive in
the same sense as the Delbaen–Schachermayer boundary `ContinuousMarket` records.
`superReplication_eq_emm_price` does not close the finite-state Farkas gap in
`Foundations/SuperhedgingDuality`: separation proves the duality there, martingale
representation proves it here, and neither implies the other.

**The gap named in the last paragraph is closed by Leap 6 (2026-08-16).** `∫ φ dS` now exists,
`PricesGainsAtZero` is derivable rather than assumed, and the hedge is held in the price. The
paragraph above stands as written — every statement in it is still true — but the absence it
records is no longer an absence.

## Leap 6 — the chain rule: the hedge is held in the *price* (2026-08-16)

`MathFin/Foundations/ItoIntegralAgainstMartingale.lean`,
`MathFin/Foundations/MarketCompletenessInPrice.lean`,
`MathFin/Foundations/PricingMeasureL2Density.lean`.

Leap 5 identified the image of `φ ↦ ∫₀ᵀ φ dB` exactly, and with it produced a hedge. What it
could not say is that the hedge is a *holding in the traded asset*: the wealth it builds is an
integral against `B`, and a trader holds units of `S`. Six places in the repo recorded the same
missing primitive, `∫ φ dS`. Leap 6 builds it.

The construction is a transport, not a second tower. For a driver `φ`, the Itô integral process
`M = φ●B` has bracket `d⟨M⟩ = φ² ds` in the standard theory — the repo constructs no pathwise
quadratic-variation *object*, so `bracketMeasure` is *defined* as `φ²·trim_T`; but the reading
is no longer only motivation: `norm_sq_increment_eq_bracket` proves the unconditional second
moment `𝔼[(M_b − M_a)²] = ⟨M⟩((a,b] × Ω)`, the defining property quadratic variation is for, at
the level of expectations (the conditional refinement landed 2026-08-27, below). So the integrands
square-integrable against `M` are the weighted space `L²(φ²·trim_T)`; and `ψ ↦ ψφ` is an
isometry from it into `L²(trim_T)`. Composing with `itoIntegralCLM_T` gives `∫· dM` with the
right domain and the right isometry for free.

| Theorem | Content |
|---|---|
| `LpMulIsometry.mulLI` | Multiplication by `f` as a `LinearIsometry` `L²(f²·ν) →ₗᵢ L²(ν)`. Mathlib has only `p = 1` (`withDensitySMulLI`), where density and multiplier coincide; at `p = 2` the multiplier is the density's square root, which is what makes the norm come out right. The content is well-definedness: `{f = 0}` is `(f²·ν)`-null but not `ν`-null, so representatives of one class can differ on a `ν`-non-null set — and the map is still well defined, because on `{f = 0}` both products vanish. |
| `PredictableDensityGeneral.simpleAssembly_sqWeight_denseRange` | Simple processes are dense in the weighted `L²`. The flat π-λ induction is not ported: its core only ever uses *integrability*, so the weight moves into the integrand as `h := f²·g`, which is `L¹` and generally not `L²` — which is why the core had to be weakened from an `L²` class to an integrable function. |
| `ItoIntegralAgainstMartingale.itoIntegralAgainst_eq_itoIntegral` | **The chain rule.** `∫ψ dM = ∫ψφ dB`. |
| `ItoIntegralAgainstMartingale.norm_itoIntegralAgainstCLM` | The Itô isometry against `M`: `‖∫ψ dM‖_{L²(μ)} = ‖ψ‖_{L²(⟨M⟩)}`. |
| **`ItoIntegralAgainstMartingale.itoIntegralAgainst_elementary`** | **What earns the name.** On a band `Z·1_{(a,b]}` with `Z` bounded and `𝓕_a`-measurable, the integral is `Z·(M_b − M_a)` — the Riemann–Stieltjes sum. Defining by a formula proves nothing; this is the theorem that says the formula computes the integral one wanted. Both halves came from the locality file: `1_{(a,b]}·φ` is a difference of two `restrictAfterCLM`, and the `𝓕_a`-measurable factor passes through by `itoIntegralCLM_T_smulAdapted`. |
| `MarketCompletenessInPrice.exists_replicating_strategy_in_price` | **Completeness, in the price.** Every square-integrable `𝓕ᴮ_T`-claim is the terminal wealth of a *unique* holding `ψ` in `S = S₀ + (σ●B)`. Only `σ ≠ 0` a.e. is needed, not a uniform lower bound: `‖ψ‖²_{L²(⟨S⟩)} = ∫(φ/σ)²σ² = ‖φ‖²`, so the weighted norm rescales and the holding is admissible however small `σ` gets. |
| `ItoIntegralAgainstMartingale.itoIntegralAgainst_simpleProcess` | **The band identity, summed.** `∫V dM = ∑ₚ V(p)·(M_{p.2} − M_{p.1})` for a simple process, which is what makes `itoIntegralAgainst_unique_of_riemannStieltjes` able to take agreement with the *written-out* sums as its hypothesis rather than agreement with the integral being characterised. |
| `ItoIntegralAgainstMartingale.bracketMeasure_mulLI` | **The tower closes on itself.** `d⟨ψ●M⟩ = ψ² d⟨M⟩`: an Itô integral against an Itô integral is again one, the brackets composing the way the integrands do. Densities multiply, and that is the whole proof. |
| `ItoIntegralAgainstMartingale.norm_sq_increment_eq_bracket` | **The bracket earns its name.** `𝔼[(M_b − M_a)²] = ⟨M⟩((a,b] × Ω)` — the second moment of an increment is the bracket measure of its time band, which is the defining property quadratic variation is for, at the level of expectations (the conditional form `𝔼[(M_b−M_a)² \| 𝓕_a] = 𝔼[⟨M⟩_b − ⟨M⟩_a \| 𝓕_a]` stays unclaimed). One band: the increment is the integral of `bandRestrict`, the isometry turns the norm into an integral, and the band representative reads it off `(a,b] × Ω`. |
| **`PointwiseBracket.condExp_band_second_moment`** | **The bracket is conditional.** `𝔼[(M_b − M_a)² \| 𝓕_a] =ᵐ 𝔼[⟨M⟩_b − ⟨M⟩_a \| 𝓕_a]`, with `⟨M⟩_b − ⟨M⟩_a` the *pathwise* `∫_a^b φ_u(ω)² du` (`bracketRep`) — the form the bracket *measure* cannot state, because it integrates `ω` out. The identity is the Itô isometry localised: for `F ∈ 𝓕_a` the indicator `𝟙_F` is a bounded `𝓕_a`-measurable factor, so `itoIntegralCLM_T_smulAdapted` folds it inside the integral and `𝟙_F² = 𝟙_F` costs nothing; both set-integrals then meet at `∫_{(a,b]×F} φ²`, one by the isometry, the other by Tonelli through the trim. No density argument, no polarisation, no ε-extension. **Not claimed:** that `bracketRep` is adapted (hence the conditional expectation on the right, which is the classical statement), and no pathwise quadratic variation. |
| **`BracketCompensator.condExp_sq_sub_bracket`** | **The bracket compensates the square.** `𝔼[M_b² − ⟨M⟩_b \| 𝓕_a] =ᵐ M_a² − ⟨M⟩_a` — what makes `⟨M⟩` *the* compensator of `M²` rather than a formula with a suggestive name. It needs the bracket **adapted**, which the previous round explicitly declined to claim: `⇑φ` is predictable, and the predictable σ-algebra mixes every `𝓕_s`. The fix is a *trace* statement — intersected with a band `(a,b] × Ω`, every predictable set is `Borel(ℝ≥0) ⊗ 𝓕_b`-measurable, because on a generator `(c,d] × F` the **left** endpoint decides (either `c ≤ b`, so `F ∈ 𝓕_c ⊆ 𝓕_b`, or `c > b`, so the intersection is empty). That asymmetry is exactly what predictability buys, and it is the whole reason the bracket ends up adapted. Clamp, integrate the time variable out, and `⟨M⟩_a` splits off the conditional expectation; the cross term collapses by the martingale property of `M`. **Not claimed:** any pathwise quadratic variation, a bundled `Martingale` structure (the `Lp`-valued `M` gives only a.e. adaptedness), or Doob–Meyer for a general submartingale. |
| **`PricingMeasureL2Density.measure_eq_of_density`** | **The capstone.** If an adapted process agreeing a.e. with `S` is a `Q`-martingale and `Q = D·μ` with `D ∈ L²(μ)`, then `Q` agrees with `μ` on all of `𝓕ᴮ_T`. Leap 5's `PricesGainsAtZero` is a *conclusion* here, not a hypothesis. |
| `MarketCompletenessInPrice.pricePathCondExp` | **The adaptedness the `Lp` process does not have.** `Martingale` requires adaptedness pointwise; an `Lp`-valued process supplies only its a.e. version, so `Martingale (pricePath …) 𝓕 Q` is a hypothesis with no exhibited witness. Rebuilding the price from `μ[· | 𝓕_t]` — adapted by construction, a.e. equal by `itoProcessCLM_eq_condExpL2` — supplies one, and `exists_density_price_martingale` assembles it. Without this the capstone would be true and empty. |

The pricing-measure argument is four steps, and none of them is stochastic integration under
`Q`. The functional `ψ ↦ 𝔼_Q[∫ψ dS]` is `⟪D, ∫ψ dS⟫` — an inner product against a fixed `L²(μ)`
element composed with an isometry — so continuity is `innerSL`'s and square-integrability of the
density is exactly what buys it. On a band the integral is `Z·(S_b − S_a)`, a bounded predictable
weight against a `Q`-martingale increment, whose mean is zero by a lemma that predates all of
this (`ContinuousMarket.increment_integral_zero`, previously private). A simple process is the
finite sum of its bands. And the simple processes are dense. That is the whole proof.

**The abstraction boundary, again drawn deliberately.** Square-integrability of the density is
not removable by this argument — it is what makes the functional continuous, and without it the
dense-set step has nothing to stand on. The price is **driftless**: `S = S₀ + (σ●B)`, which is
what a discounted price is under the reference measure; a drift `∫b ds` is additive, reuses the
pathwise drift object the Girsanov work already built, and is what the HJM bond dynamics need.
Only `complete ⟹ unique` is delivered; the converse still needs Jacod–Yor. And the agreement
`Q = μ` is **on `𝓕ᴮ_T`** — it says nothing off that σ-algebra. Finally, the band identity is for a
single band: the summed version over a general simple process is not stated as a theorem, only
the `Lp` decomposition it would follow from, and the uniqueness clause takes agreement on simple
processes rather than on written-out Riemann–Stieltjes sums. Degenne's axiomatic
`IsStochasticIntegral` is the right frame for that clause and exists only on `v4.33.0-rc1`, so
instantiating it waits for a stable pin.
