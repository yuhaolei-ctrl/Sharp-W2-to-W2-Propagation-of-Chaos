# Static Black-Scholes option-price bounds — re-export

The unified narrative — `Phi_le_one`, `bsV_le_S`, `bsP_le_K_disc`,
`box_spread_identity`, and the broader no-arbitrage rectangle — has been
absorbed into `PriceBounds.lean`, where it sits alongside the parity-driven
forward lower bound and the Merton 1973 strict-dominance result.

This file is retained as an import path; importing it pulls in the same
namespace `MathFin` containing all the bound theorems.
