# Locality of the Itô integral — in the sample space, and in time

The Itô integral is linear over the reals by construction — it is a CLM. It is
in fact linear over something much larger: over the **`𝓕_a`-measurable random
scalars**, provided the integrand lives on `(a, T]`. Concretely,

  `∫₀ᵀ Z·φ dB = Z·∫₀ᵀ φ dB`   whenever `Z` is `𝓕_a`-measurable and `φ = 0` on `[0,a]`.

This is the *locality* of the stochastic integral: what the integral does after
time `a` may be scaled by anything the past has already decided, and the scaling
commutes with the integration. It is the structural fact behind every "freeze
the past, integrate the future" argument — the multiplicative decomposition of a
Doléans exponential over a partition, the Markov/tower manipulations of
`∫ₐᵀ`, and the induction that builds a step-integrand Doléans exponential out of
the constant-integrand one. Nothing in the tower had it; it is proved here once,
for a general bounded (and then, by localisation, a general `L²`-compatible)
factor `Z`.

## The proof, and the definitional wrinkle it has to survive

`(t, ω) ↦ Z ω` is **not** a predictable process: predictability at times `t < a`
would force `Z` to be `𝓕_t`-measurable. What *is* predictable is `Z` switched on
after `a`,

  `afterFactor a Z (t, ω) = 𝟙_{a < t}·Z ω`,

because `Ioi a ×ˢ F` with `F ∈ 𝓕_a` is one of the generating predictable
rectangles. So the scaling operator `smulAdaptedCLM` multiplies by `afterFactor`,
which makes it a genuine norm-`≤ |C|` CLM on the *whole* of `L²(trim_T)` (a
`Z`-independent bonus: `Z = 1` gives the restriction-to-`(a,T]` projection
`restrictAfterCLM`), and the identity `Z·φ` for the coefficient is recovered
exactly on the integrands supported after `a` (`coeFn_smulAdapted`).

With that in place the proof is the standard two-step:

* **simple processes** — a `T`-bounded simple process `V` restarted at `a` and
  scaled by `Z` (`afterStepSP`) is again a `T`-bounded simple process: the
  rectangle `(p.1, p.2]` becomes `(a ⊔ p.1, p.2]`, and `Z·V(p)` is still
  measurable at the new left endpoint precisely because `a ≤ a ⊔ p.1`. Its
  elementary integral is `Z` times the unscaled one, term by term.
* **density** — both sides are continuous in `φ`, and the simple embeddings are
  dense (`simpleAssembly_T_denseRange`), so `DenseRange.equalizer` closes it.

The unbounded corollary needs no dominated convergence: apply the bounded result
twice on the `𝓕_a`-set `{|Z| ≤ M}` — once with factor `𝟙` against the integrand
`Z·φ`, once with factor `𝟙·Z` against `φ` — the two scaled integrands coincide,
and `⋃_M {|Z| ≤ M} = Ω` finishes by countable union of a.e. statements.

The reusable abstraction extracted along the way is `mulBddCLM`: multiplication
by a bounded measurable function as a continuous operator on `L²`, for an
arbitrary measure. Both the integrand-side scaling (on `trim_T`) and the
sample-side scaling (on `μ`) are instances of it.

## Locality in time

The same word governs the time variable: an integrand that lives on one side of
a time `u` has an integral that lives on that side too. Both halves are read off
the time-indexed Itô isometry `‖(φ●B)_u‖² = ∫_{(0,u]} φ²`
(`ItoIntegralProcessGeneral.itoProcessCLM_norm_sq`):

* switched on only after `u` ⟹ `(φ●B)_u = 0` — its band energy is zero;
* switched off after `u` ⟹ `∫₀ᵀ φ dB = (φ●B)_u`, hence `𝓕_u`-measurable. Here the
  band energy is the *whole* energy, so the `𝓕_u`-projection of `∫₀ᵀ φ dB` has full
  norm; and a norm-preserving orthogonal projection is the identity on that vector
  (`condExpL2` is definitionally `Submodule.orthogonalProjectionOnto`, so the Hilbert
  API applies verbatim).

Subtracting the two gives `∫₀ᵀ 𝟙_{(u,T]}·φ dB = ∫₀ᵀ φ dB − (φ●B)_u`
(`itoIntegralCLM_T_restrictAfterCLM`): restricting an integrand to `(u,T]` removes
exactly the past of its integral. That is what turns a *terminal* identity, which is
all an Itô formula hands out, into an identity for an inner increment — the shape a
Doléans exponential over a partition needs.

## The sample-side form of the integrand hypothesis

`itoIntegralCLM_T_smulAdapted_of_memLp` asks for `Z·φ ∈ L²(trim)`, a statement about
the integrand. Callers that obtained `φ` from an Itô formula have no handle on it, but
do know `∫φ dB` explicitly, and so can check `Z·∫φ dB ∈ L²(μ)` instead. The isometry
says these are the same requirement, and `itoIntegralCLM_T_smul_of_memLp` performs the
transfer: truncating `Z` at level `M` gives genuine integrands whose energies *are* the
sample-side energies, uniformly bounded; they converge pointwise to `Z·φ`, and Fatou
carries the bound to the limit.

## Result

* `memLp_mul_of_bdd`, `mulBddCLM`, `coeFn_mulBddCLM` — multiplication by a bounded measurable
  function as a continuous operator on `L²`, and its characterising a.e. identity.
* `afterFactor`, `abs_afterFactor_le`, `measurable_afterFactor` — the `𝓕_a`-measurable factor
  switched on after `a`, the bound it inherits from `Z`, and its predictability.
* `smulAdaptedCLM`, `coeFn_smulAdaptedCLM` — scaling a predictable `L²` integrand by that
  factor, as a CLM.
* `smulAdapted`, `coeFn_smulAdapted_afterFactor`, `coeFn_smulAdapted` — the same scaling
  applied to one integrand, unfolded unconditionally and (the switch being invisible there)
  on integrands supported after `a`.
* `restrictAfterCLM`, `restrictAfterCLM_eq`, `coeFn_restrictAfterCLM` — the `Z = 1` instance:
  restriction of an integrand to `(a,T]`.
* `ae_fst_ne_zero` — the time origin is `trim_T`-null.
* `afterStepSP` — a `T`-bounded simple process restarted at `a` and scaled by `Z`.
* `itoIntegralCLM_T_smulAdapted` — **`𝓕_a`-linearity** for a bounded factor.
* `itoIntegralCLM_T_smulAdapted_of_memLp` — the same for an unbounded factor, under the
  integrand-side hypothesis `Z·φ ∈ L²(trim)`.
* `itoIntegralCLM_T_smul_of_memLp` — and under the sample-side hypothesis
  `Z·∫₀ᵀ φ dB ∈ L²(μ)` instead.
* `itoProcessCLM_eq_zero_of_vanishes_before` — an integrand switched on only after `u` has
  `(φ●B)_u = 0`.
* `itoIntegralCLM_T_eq_itoProcessCLM_of_vanishes_after` — one switched off after `u` has
  `∫₀ᵀ φ dB = (φ●B)_u`, hence a `𝓕_u`-measurable integral.
* `itoIntegralCLM_T_restrictAfterCLM` — restricting an integrand to `(u,T]` subtracts exactly
  `(φ●B)_u` from its integral.

/-- **The hypothesis in its sample-side form.** `itoIntegralCLM_T_smulAdapted_of_memLp`
asks for `Z·φ ∈ L²(trim)`; a caller whose `φ` came out of an Itô formula knows nothing
about it, but does know `∫φ dB`, and so can offer `Z·∫φ dB ∈ L²(μ)` instead. The Itô
isometry makes these the same requirement: truncating `Z` at level `M` gives genuine
integrands `𝟙_{|Z|≤M}·Z·φ` whose energies *are* the sample-side energies
`‖𝟙_{|Z|≤M}·Z·∫φ dB‖ ≤ ‖Z·∫φ dB‖`, uniformly bounded; they converge pointwise to `Z·φ`,
so Fatou bounds its energy too. The extra `⇑ψ =ᵐ Z·φ` conclusion is what lets a caller
inherit the *support* of `φ`. -/

/-- **Restricting an integrand to `(u,T]` removes exactly the past of the integral.**
`∫₀ᵀ 𝟙_{(u,T]}·φ dB = ∫₀ᵀ φ dB − (φ●B)_u`: the complementary piece `𝟙_{(0,u]}·φ` is
switched off after `u`, so its integral is the process value at `u`
(`itoIntegralCLM_T_eq_itoProcessCLM_of_vanishes_after`), and the restriction itself
contributes nothing at `u` (`itoProcessCLM_eq_zero_of_vanishes_before`). This is the
lemma that converts a terminal Itô identity into one for an inner increment. -/
