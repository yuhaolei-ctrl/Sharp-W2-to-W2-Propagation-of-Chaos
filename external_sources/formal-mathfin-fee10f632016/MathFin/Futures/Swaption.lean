# Black model for swaptions — re-export

The Black-model swaption pricing (payer + receiver + parity) has been folded
into `Futures/Black76.lean`, where it sits next to the base Black-76 futures
formula — both are specialisations of the same `F · Φ(d_1) − K · Φ(d_2)`
structure, with the swap-rate version scaled by the annuity numéraire `A`.

The namespace `MathFin` exposes `blackPayerSwaption`,
`blackReceiverSwaption`, and `swaption_payer_receiver_parity` through the
transitive import.
