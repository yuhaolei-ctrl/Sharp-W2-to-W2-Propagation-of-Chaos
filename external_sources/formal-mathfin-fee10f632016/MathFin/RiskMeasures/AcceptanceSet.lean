# Coherent risk measures: the Artzner–Delbaen–Eber–Heath representation (finite state)

A coherent risk measure `ρ` on `ι → ℝ` (finite state space) is, by its four ADEH axioms, the supremum
of expected loss `∑ qᵢ (-Xᵢ)` over a set of representing probability measures `q`. The geometric content
is convex duality: the **acceptance cone** `{X | ρ X ≤ 0}` is a closed convex cone, and a rejected
position is separated from it by a representing density — the *same* Hahn–Banach separation that gives
the FTAP its equivalent martingale measure (here via the point-from-cone primitive
`MathFin.exists_separating_of_not_mem_cone`). This is the risk-side face of the convex-duality unification.

The representation is stated as `IsLUB` (ρ X is the least upper bound of the expected losses), which is
the precise "ρ = sup over measures" statement without the conditionally-complete-lattice `iSup` overhead.

/-- **Coherent-risk representation (Artzner–Delbaen–Eber–Heath, finite state).** A coherent risk
measure `ρ` is the supremum of expected loss over its representing probability measures: `ρ X` is the
least upper bound of `{∑ qᵢ (-Xᵢ) | q ∈ representingSet ρ}`. The upper bound is cash-invariance; the
least-upper-bound is the point-from-cone separation of the rejected position `X + (ρX - ε)·1` from the
acceptance cone, normalised to a representing density. -/
