# Equivalent probability measure from a positive normalised density

A measurable, strictly-positive, `P`-integrable density `g` with `∫ g ∂P = 1` defines an
**equivalent probability measure** `P.withDensity (fun ω ↦ ENNReal.ofReal (g ω))`: it is a
probability measure (total mass `∫ g = 1`) and mutually absolutely continuous with `P`
(`withDensity` is always `≪ P`, and `P ≪` it because the density is a.e. nonzero).

This is the change-of-measure ritual shared by the equivalent-martingale-measure constructions
in the one-period FTAP files (`FTAPOnePeriod.lean`, `FTAPOnePeriodVector.lean`): each builds its
fair density (a logistic Esscher weight, or a `(1+‖Y‖)⁻¹` tempering for the `L¹` reduction),
normalises it, and then needs exactly these three facts.

/-- A measurable, strictly-positive, `P`-integrable density `g` with `∫ g ∂P = 1` makes
`Q = P.withDensity (fun ω ↦ ENNReal.ofReal (g ω))` a probability measure equivalent to `P`:
`IsProbabilityMeasure Q`, `Q ≪ P`, and `P ≪ Q`. -/
