# A reified payoff language

`Payoff ι` and `Contract ι` represent *what an instrument pays*, independently of
any stochastic model. Market outcomes enter through `Scenario ι = ι → ℝ≥0 → ℝ`;
a stochastic model is a law on that type, and appears only from
`Contracts/Pricing.lean` onward.

Every other payoff in this library — `BlackScholes/Call.lean`, `Digital.lean`,
`CappedCall.lean` — is written inline as a lambda inside the integral that prices
it, so the payoff and the model are the same syntactic object. This file
separates them, which is what lets `Contracts/CappedCall.lean` price a capped
call by *composing* two European call values rather than by evaluating a third
integral.

## Deliberately absent

Branching contracts (`ifThen`), currency, and the lifecycle layer (outstanding
notional, termination, partial redemption). Each is additive and each waits for
the corpus entry that forces it; see
`docs/specs/2026-08-16-contracts-tower-design.md` §2.3.

## Main results

* `Contract.pathPV_both`, `Contract.pathPV_scale` — `pathPV` is additive over
  `both` and homogeneous over `scale`. These are what `Contracts/Pricing.lean`
  integrates to get linearity of `value`.

## Source

The layered separation of contract semantics from pricing semantics, and the
framing "the contract is not the model", are due to Paul Bilokon,
*The Contract Is Not the Model: Proof-Carrying Exotic Derivatives and the
Economics of Model Risk* (working paper, 9 August 2026; Mathematical
Finance, Imperial College London), with code at
<https://github.com/thalesians/lean_contracts> (Apache-2.0). That paper in
turn builds on the compositional contract-DSL of
Peyton Jones, Eber and Seward (2000) and the certified-contract work of Bahr,
Berthold and Elsman (2015) and Annenkov (2018).

This file takes his separation of the payoff object from the probability law.
The type design is ours: a typed underlying index rather than `String` keys, a
single inductive rather than a mutual `NumExpr` / `BoolExpr` pair, and `ℝ≥0` time
matching `Filtration ℝ≥0 mΩ`.

No code is copied from `lean_contracts`; every definition and proof here is
written for this library. See `docs/specs/2026-08-16-contracts-tower-design.md`
§6 for the full credit line.
