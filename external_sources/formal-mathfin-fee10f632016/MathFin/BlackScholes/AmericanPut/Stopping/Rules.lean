# Admissible finite-horizon stopping rules

Rules are nonnegative, finite stopping times for an explicit filtration and
are bounded pointwise by the horizon. Measurability is derived from the
stopping-time condition, not added as a separate restriction.

## Result

Public entry points include `BoundedRule`, `measurable_time`, `constant`, `zero`.
