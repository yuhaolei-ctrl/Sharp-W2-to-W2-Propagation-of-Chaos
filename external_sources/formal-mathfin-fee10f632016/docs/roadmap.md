# Math depth roadmap

This document captures the strategic discussion from 2026-05-22 on what
"ultimate Lean/Mathlib mathematical finance repo" actually means, why depth beats
breadth at this stage, and what the concrete next round would look like.

## 2026-06-29 — POST-ITÔ STRATEGIC UPDATE: the gate is open (supersedes the "out of reach" framing below)

> **Update (2026-07-16) — optimal market making, single-asset closed-form (corpus 330 → 333).** A new
> breadth axis opens: `Foundations/MarketMakingRiccati` formalizes the single-asset (`d = 1`) closed-form
> (LQ/Riccati) approximation of Bergault–Evangelista–Guéant–Vieira (arXiv:1810.04383). Three `full`
> entries — the Riccati coefficient `mf-mm-riccati` (`a(t) = Â·tanh(Â(T−t))` solves `a' = a² − Â²`; the
> `tanh` derivative is derived locally, Mathlib carrying none at this pin), the value-function verification
> `mf-mm-value-function` (the quadratic ansatz solves the **approximate** quadratic-Hamiltonian HJ equation
> given the Riccati/linear ODE system — Prop. 1 at `d = 1`, the `B`/`C` coefficients certified by the `ring`
> closure), and the closed-form quotes `mf-mm-quotes` (constant half-spread + inventory-linear skew,
> instantiated at the Model-A/Model-B constants). **Honest scope** (mirroring `mf-almgren-chriss-EL`): the
> *approximate* HJ solution only — the stochastic-control substrate (true value function + verification
> theorem), the approximation-to-truth (numerical in the paper), the multi-asset matrix-Riccati case, and the
> `T → ∞` ergodic limit are deferred follow-ups. Natural next rungs: the **matrix Riccati** (multi-asset, via
> `Matrix.exp` + spectral decomposition) and the Appendix-A **jump (Brémaud–Jacod) Girsanov** construction
> (wiring into the change-of-measure engine).
>
> **Update (2026-07-16, later) — the matrix Riccati rung landed (corpus 333 → 335).** The multi-asset
> follow-on above is now done: `Foundations/MatrixMarketMakingRiccati` formalizes the **matrix-Riccati core of
> BEGV Proposition 2** (the `A`-coefficient + change of variables; `B`/`C` and the value-function verification
> stay out of scope), the matrix analogue of the scalar closed form. Two `full` entries — `mf-mm-matrix-riccati` (the abstract matrix
> Riccati ODE `a'(t) = a(t)·a(t) − Â·Â` solved in closed form for any Hermitian `Â`) and `mf-mm-matrix-value`
> (its market-making instantiation `A' = 2·A·D₊·A − (γ/2)·Σ` via the `D₊^{±½}` change of variables). The key
> move is **spectral reduction, not `Matrix.exp`**: with `Â = U·diag(λ)·Uᴴ`, defining
> `a(t) = U·diag(riccatiCoeff (λᵢ) T t)·Uᴴ` reduces the matrix ODE, on each eigenvalue, to the *scalar*
> `hasDerivAt_riccatiCoeff` — no matrix `tanh` (absent at this pin) is ever built. Mathlib carries no
> matrix-valued differentiation, so the matrix-level `HasDerivAt` is taken under the `L∞` operator norm
> (`open scoped Matrix.Norms.Operator`), lifting the diagonal core's derivative through `diagonalLinearMap`.
> **Honest scope**: in `mf-mm-matrix-value`, `Â` enters by its defining relation `Â·Â = γ·(D₊^{½}ΣD₊^{½})`
> (the matrix-square-root *construction* is out of scope — the verified content is the change of variables);
> the `B`/`C` coefficients (matrix variation-of-parameters), the general-`d` value-function verification, and
> the optimal-control substrate remain deferred.
>
> **Direction (course-correction, 2026-07-16).** These two entries are a deliberate *flag-plant* — the
> library's first matrix-analytic finance (eigendecomposition, a committed matrix-norm policy, spectral
> reduction) — not the start of a market-making build-out. The Riccati is the **LQ-approximation** view; the
> *fundamental* structure is the exact Hopf–Cole linearisation of the Avellaneda–Stoikov HJB into a linear
> ODE system / matrix exponential (Guéant–Lehalle–Fernandez-Tapia), which the exact multi-asset problem lacks
> a closed form for (hence BEGV approximate). So we **stop the Riccati drill** here: the `B`/`C` refinements,
> the matrix-sqrt existence, and the `T→∞` limit are *within-the-approximation* items, deprioritised. If we
> ever deepen market making, the honest target is the **exact linearisation** (a real project, matrix-exp-gated),
> not more approximation. Market making is a stochastic-control *satellite*, orthogonal to the library's depth
> spine (Itô → Girsanov → FTAP); the leverage stays on that spine — the DMW FTAP crown, the 2D covariation Itô,
> Girsanov L²/Novikov — which is where results compound. (The Appendix-A **jump Girsanov** remains a candidate
> only because it wires into the existing change-of-measure engine, not because it grows the MM island.)
>
> **Update (2026-06-29, evening) — Phase 1 done (corpus 306).** Since this strategic update, the
> **convex-duality unification** (I↔IV — the architecture doc's #1 seam,
> [`mathematical-architecture.md`](mathematical-architecture.md)) was realized: the FTAP (pricing) and
> the coherent-risk representation (risk) are now *one* Hahn–Banach root (`Foundations/ConvexDuality`,
> `RiskMeasures/AcceptanceSet`). That was the most-tractable, highest-leverage seam (finite-dim convex
> analysis, no Itô dependency). The Itô-track crown jewels below are next — **Girsanov (#2)** is the
> queued bridge ([#40](https://github.com/formal-applied-math/formal-mathfin/issues/40); first brick = the
> adapted Doléans–Dade exponential), and the superhedging strong-duality *equality* hit a Mathlib
> **Farkas gap** ([#39](https://github.com/formal-applied-math/formal-mathfin/issues/39)).

> **Update (2026-06-30) — Phase 2: Girsanov, the martingale side (corpus 308).** The continuous EMM is
> now an *explicit* change of measure: `Foundations/Girsanov.bs_discounted_isQMartingale` tilts the
> physical measure by the Girsanov density `Q = withDensity(exp(−θX_T − ½θ²T))` (constant `θ = (μ−r)/σ`)
> and proves the discounted stock a `Q`-martingale on `[0,T]`, on a reusable Bayes engine
> `Foundations/ChangeOfMeasure.changeOfMeasure_setIntegral_eq` — **retiring the Wald shortcut**. The

> **Itô formula for a function of an `∫θ dB` process** (and a pathwise QV `⟨∫θdB⟩ = ∫θ² ds`), *neither*

> `reduced_core`, honestly documented — an Itô-tower item to re-scout, not force. See
> [#40](https://github.com/formal-applied-math/formal-mathfin/issues/40).

> **Update (2026-07-05) — Phase 2 distributional Girsanov, CONSTANT θ FULLY CLOSED (corpus 314).** The

> `Foundations/GirsanovConstantTheta.Btheta_isQBrownianMotion` proves the drift-corrected
> `B^θ_t = X_t + θ t` is a genuine `Q`-Brownian motion: zero start, Gaussian increments
> `B^θ_t − B^θ_s ~ N(0, t−s)`, **and** independence of disjoint increments (corpus `gir-const-theta-qbm`,

> **Refactored 2026-07-06:** this ten-lemma characteristic-function chain is now the reusable,
> process-agnostic `Foundations/ExpMartingaleQBrownian.isQBrownianMotion_of_expMartingale` — const-θ

> [#40](https://github.com/formal-applied-math/formal-mathfin/issues/40).
>
> **Update (2026-07-06) — SIMPLE (piecewise-constant) adapted θ FULLY CLOSED (corpus 315).** The
> abstraction paid off: `Foundations/GirsanovSimpleTheta.Btheta_simple_isQBrownianMotion` (corpus
> `gir-simple-adapted`, `full`) proves `B^θ_t = X_t + ∑_i c_i(s_{i+1}∧t − s_i∧t)` is a `Q`-Brownian
> motion for bounded `𝓕_{s i}`-measurable multipliers — the general bounded-**adapted**-θ Girsanov for
> the simple case, strictly beyond constant θ, via the spine `simple_spine_ae` fed to the Bayes engine
> with an `L²`-Hölder mixed-time integrability, and one application of `isQBrownianMotion_of_expMartingale`
> (no charFun chain re-derived). What now stays `reduced_core` is only the **fully general
> continuous-adapted** θ (`gir-thm-9.1.8`) — it is infrastructure-gated, not sorry-blocked: the tower has

> predictable class) plus an `L²→L¹` density-convergence step — its own focused effort (brick α4, see
> `docs/plans/2026-07-06-girsanov-track-alpha.md`).

> **Update (2026-07-10) — bounded PREDICTABLE θ CLOSED (Girsanov Rung 1, corpus 319).** The Girsanov
> ladder extends one more rung: `Foundations/GirsanovPredictableTheta.Btheta_isQBrownianMotion_predictable_of_bdd`
> (new `full` entry `gir-thm-9.1.8-predictable`) drops the path-continuity of `gir-thm-9.1.8` and proves
> `B^θ_u = B_u + driftContinuousMod θ̂ u` is a `Q`-Brownian motion for a bounded **predictable** `θ` — the
> honest domain of the Itô `L²` integral. The front half is a **Route-B marshalled** density approximation:
> `θ` is approximated in `L²` by clamped dense simple processes marshalled into single-partition `(s,c)`
> form (`Foundations/SimpleProcessPartition.lean`), so the simple-θ exponential-martingale identity applies
> per `n`; where the continuous case had the drift converge *everywhere* (deterministic Riemann sums), here
> **all three** integrand functionals — stochastic integral, drift, quadratic variation — converge only in
> `μ`-measure (via the drift-modification tower's `L²`-slice energy identity), and are fused through a
> **common a.e.-subsequence** (`exists_subseq_tendsto_ae₂`) into the same set-integral engine plus a generic
> Fatou-`L²` limit (`memLp_two_of_subseq_ae_of_sq_bound`, used for both the density and the mixed-time
> product), keyed on the partition-generic moment bounds of `Foundations/GirsanovSimpleDoleansMoments.lean`.
> The limit drift is the genuinely-`𝓕`-adapted `driftContinuousMod θ̂` (=ᵐ `∫₀ᵘθds`), so no fresh
> predictable-progressive lemma was needed. **Rung 2** (fully general `L²`/progressive θ under Novikov,

> **Update (2026-07-09) — CONTINUOUS bounded-adapted θ FULLY CLOSED; Track-α COMPLETE (corpus 318).** Both

>   same tension, now named by axis.**

A whole-program validation (three independent reviewers + maintainer adjudication + the env-linter)
re-grounds the strategy. **The 2026-05-22 head below is now partly stale, and that staleness is the
single most important finding.** That section says the deep tier is *"out of reach … needs a fuller
stochastic-calculus layer (unrestricted Itô, continuous-time Girsanov, BSDEs)"* and files Girsanov/SDE
under *"explicitly out of scope (itô-gated, do not attempt without upstream)"* — predicting *"when Itô
lands, the deepest quant results become possible."* **Itô has since landed** (Summits A–C; the phase log
records it). The library spent a month building the exact gate it named, then never walked through it.

**Validation verdict (where the program stands):**
- **Floor — solid.** An adversarial pass over the headline `full` entries (Itô tower, BS-PDE keystone,
  FTAP rungs, CRR→BS, Greeks) found no overclaims: hypotheses honest, scope documented, axioms clean.
- **Infrastructure — exceeds world-class in rigor, with minor cosmetic gaps.** The input-hash
  verification ledger, per-theorem `#print axioms` audit, kernel-replay, and the values-review cadence
  exceed what Mathlib/FLT/Carleson ship. Genuine gaps are operational/cosmetic: no doc-gen4 API site,
  no Leanblueprint web render. (The env-linter is now wired — `lake lint`, advisory.)
- **Itô tower — publishable-grade, scalar-by-design, with navigability friction.** The Summit-C
  double-cutoff localization is exemplary. Scalar-only is deliberate. Real debt: naming-suffix drift
  (`_T`/`_Infinite`/`_TD`/none) and no single exported "the Itô formula."
- **THE CEILING — the 17 `reduced_core` entries.** These are spec-level *encodings* (a `structure`
  whose fields assume the conclusion), written when the deep theorems were genuinely out of reach.
  **Girsanov, SDE existence/uniqueness, martingale representation, Lévy's characterization are stubs.**
  *(Update: Girsanov `gir-thm-9.1.8` landed 2026-07-09, SDE `sc-thm-8.2.5` 2026-07-03, martingale
  representation `gir-thm-9.3.4` 2026-08-07. Of this list only Novikov `gir-thm-9.1.7` and Lévy's
  characterization `sc-thm-9.1.1` are still `reduced_core`; the count is now 13.)*
  This — a magnificent Itô tower whose deepest intended consumers are still stubs — is the precise gap
  between "very-good structural-depth library" and "top-notch stochastic-finance library."

**The path to top-notch — cash in the Itô tower (verified reachable, NOT upstream-gated):**
The crown-jewel conversions build on assets that already exist (`waldExponential_isMartingale`,
`itoIntegralCLM_T` + its isometry, `withDensity` change-of-measure, the static `GaussianGirsanov`
Esscher tilt). They do **not** depend on the one genuinely upstream-gated frontier (general
adapted-coefficient Itô, blocked on Degenne's continuous-modification π-system). Ranked by value × feasibility:

| # | Conversion (reduced_core → full) | Value | Difficulty | Unlocks |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Novikov** (gir-thm-9.1.7) | 9 | MEDIUM (~150-200 ln) | the gateway: the adapted Doléans-Dade exponential `Z_t=exp(∫θdB−½∫θ²ds)` as a martingale |
| 2 | **Girsanov** — martingale + distributional (const → simple → continuous adapted) ✅ (2026-06-30 → 2026-07-09) | 9 | DONE (bounded adapted continuous θ): `bs_discounted_isQMartingale` = the EMM as an explicit measure change + a reusable Bayes engine; the distributional Girsanov `Btheta_isQBrownianMotion` (const) → `Btheta_simple_isQBrownianMotion` (simple) → **`Btheta_isQBrownianMotion_adapted` (bounded adapted continuous, `gir-thm-9.1.8` `full`)**, all one application of the process-agnostic `isQBrownianMotion_of_expMartingale` — spine-free, no adapted-integrand Itô formula, no Novikov crux. Only the strictly more general `L²`/progressive-θ under Novikov (`sc-thm-9.1.8`) stays open | risk-neutral pricing under measure change |
| 3 | **SDE existence/uniqueness** (sc-thm-8.2.5) | 9 | HIGH (~300-400) | the SDE model zoo (Vasicek/CIR/Heston/jump-diffusion) — Picard on the Itô isometry |
| 4 | **Martingale representation** (gir-thm-9.3.4) ✅ (2026-08-07) | 9 | DONE, and the feared Clark-Hida/upstream route was not the one taken: `itoIntegralCLM_T_surjective_onto_centered` gets surjectivity from an orthogonal decomposition against the (closed) range plus totality of the step Doléans exponentials — no Malliavin calculus, no adapted-integrand Itô formula | hedging / replication / market completeness — all three landed with it (`exists_replicating_strategy`, `superReplication_eq_emm_price`, and pricing-measure uniqueness for gains-neutral measures) |
| 5 | **2D Itô formula** (sc-thm-7.5.2) | 7 | LOW-MED | multi-asset derivatives (the 1-D TD formula is already built) |

The **first brick** for #1-#3 is the same: the adapted **Doléans-Dade stochastic exponential** as a
martingale — generalizing the existing constant-α Wald exponential to an adapted integrand via
`itoIntegralCLM_T`. Lay it once; Novikov, Girsanov, and the SDE drift-term all consume it.

**Lower-leverage / deliberately deferred** (per the reviewers): the Markov-chain reduced_core cluster
(side branch for a *continuous-time* finance library), the reflection principle / LIL / nowhere-diff
(canonical BM results, no finance consumers). **Engineering polish** (friction, not ceiling): the
Itô-tower naming consolidation, a bundled `IsBrownianMotion` structure, a doc-gen4 site, Leanblueprint
web. Do these to remove friction; they do not raise the mathematical ceiling.

**Bottom line:** the program is already top-tier in rigor and floor-integrity. The distinctive move to
top-notch is not more breadth or polish — it is to **convert the crown-jewel `reduced_core` stubs into
genuine derivations**, starting with the Doléans-Dade exponential → Novikov → Girsanov chain. That is
the work that turns "a deep tower" into "a deep tower that is actually used."

## The honest distinction

There are three different things people mean by "high-quality formal
math library":

* **Coverage**: most textbook results in the field are formalised.
  Measured by theorem count.
* **Structural depth**: the library organises results around a small
  number of *principles* whose consequences flow as one- to three-line
  corollaries. The hierarchy is visible in the file structure.
* **Original mathematics**: theorems in the library are *contributions* to
  mathematics, not formalisations of textbook material. Mathlib's
  reputation rests largely on this (sphere eversion, Polynomial
  Freiman-Ruzsa, etc.).

Our library is at *medium coverage + partial structural depth + no
original mathematics*. The third tier is out of reach: original quant-
finance mathematics either needs a fuller stochastic-calculus layer
(unrestricted Itô, continuous-time Girsanov, BSDEs — beyond the `[0,T]`
L² slice the library builds) or is research-
grade work (Föllmer-Schied dual, robust price bounds under model
uncertainty, Lee 2004 moment formula at full rigor).

What's *in reach* is more structural depth, which is what the next
round should pursue.

## Why depth beats breadth

* **Diminishing returns on breadth.** 250+ theorems is enough. Adding
  another 20 textbook verifications takes the count to 270 but doesn't
  change what the library *is*. The proof shape (`unfold; field_simp;
  ring`) tells the reader what the additions are.

* **Coverage gaps are mostly upstream-gated.** The remaining missing
  items — Heston, local vol, SABR, continuous-time Girsanov, BSDEs —
  need a fuller stochastic-calculus layer than the `[0,T]` L² Itô
  integral the library builds for itself. We can't fix that with more
  `field_simp`. (Itô's formula and Margrabe have since been delivered —
  see the phase log below.)

* **The slop ratio sharpens with more breadth.** Of the 216 "full"
  derivations, roughly 30 are genuinely non-trivial (the continuous-time
  L² Itô formula, Doob L^p,
  Wiener L² isometry, joint-stdev triangle, Kelly FOC, Sharpe √T,
  second-order immunization, Asian AM-GM, Merton-tree one-period
  dominance, etc.). The other ~180 are closed-form verifications.
  Adding 20 more closed-form checks moves the ratio from 30:180 to
  30:200 — the wrong direction.

* **Depth additions are multiplicative.** A reflection principle for
  binomial walks unlocks barrier-option pricing as a whole category.
  A continuous-convexity bridge collapses K-direction reasoning across
  the library. A discrete martingale representation makes hedging
  discussions tractable. Each depth theorem leverages future ones.

## What "ultimate Lean/Mathlib mathematical finance" looks like

Concretely:

1. **A small set of named structural principles** that *generate*
   the consequences. We have nine (Garman normal form, strike
   convexity, price bounds rectangle, Greek signs, convex pricing
   functional, gaussian MGF, exponential discount, Merton-tree
   one-period, replicating uniqueness). Target ~15.

2. **At least one genuinely-non-trivial theorem per category** —
   not just a definition + ring. Currently ~8 categories are represented
   among the ~30 non-trivial results above. Target ~15–20.

3. **An honest hierarchy** between foundational math, principles, and
   verifications. README now distinguishes the three tiers; file
   organisation could enforce it more strongly.

4. **Eventual upstream contributions to Mathlib** — when Itô lands,
   the deepest quant results become possible. The library's structure
   should be ready to accommodate them.

What it explicitly is *not*:

* The largest theorem count.
* The broadest textbook-chapter coverage.
* Original mathematics. Tao level is original mathematics; that's a
  different game.

## Concrete next-round candidates — STATUS

Three depth theorems were planned. As of 2026-05-22, **all three cores have
shipped** in `BlackScholes/StrikeConvexity.lean`, `Binomial/MertonAmericanCallTree.lean`,
and `Binomial/PathReflection.lean`:

1. **Multi-step Merton 1973 in the binomial tree** — DONE
   (`Binomial/MertonAmericanCallTree.lean`).
   `americanPrice = binomialPrice` at every horizon `n` for the non-dividend
   call (`r ≥ 0`, `K ≥ 0`). The one-period continuation dominance
   (Jensen + martingale identity + discount shift) extends to multi-step
   via induction on `n` with monotonicity of the one-period operator at
   the inductive step. Three new theorems: `call_intrinsic_le_binomialPrice`,
   `americanCallPrice_le_binomialPrice`, `americanCallPrice_eq_binomialPrice`.

2. **Continuous convexity of `K ↦ bsV K r σ S τ` on `(0, ∞)`** — DONE
   (`BlackScholes/StrikeConvexity.lean`). Bridges `ConvexPricingFunctional`
   (finite-state) to the actual BS formula via
   `convexOn_of_deriv2_nonneg'` + `hasDerivAt_bsV_KK`. K-convexity now
   visible at **three scales** in the library: payoff
   (`convexOn_call_payoff`), finite-state price
   (`callPrice_finiteState_convexOn_K`), continuous BS price
   (`bsV_strike_convexOn`). PDF positivity in `BreedenLitzenberger.lean`
   becomes an actual derivation rather than a standalone fact.

3. **Discrete reflection principle for binomial paths — full**
   — DONE (`Binomial/PathReflection.lean`, ~370 LOC, both halves landed).
   * **Algebraic core**: `walkPos (reflectAfter τ ω) k = 2·walkPos ω τ −
     walkPos ω k` for `τ ≤ k` (via prefix/suffix sum decomposition);
     `reflectAfter_involutive`; endpoint corollary.
   * **Hitting-time bijection**: `firstHit ω a`, invariance under
     reflection (`firstHit_reflectAfter_firstHit`), reflection-at-first-hit
     involution (`reflectAtFirstHit_involutive`), and the full
     **`reflectionPrincipleEquiv a b`** between `{ω : hits a, ends at b}`
     and `{ω : hits a, ends at 2a − b}` as a Mathlib `Equiv`. Both
     directions of the bijection are the same reflection map (involution).

Total ~600 LOC across three modules, all landing in one session. Each
ships a theorem whose statement is non-trivial and whose proof is real
math (calculus / induction / combinatorial sum decomposition,
respectively).

## Larger, multi-session candidates

If the project continues beyond the next round:

4. **Variance-optimal hedging in finite-state markets** (~250 LOC).
   Given a contingent claim `X` and a tradable subspace, the
   variance-optimal hedge is the `L²(q)`-orthogonal projection.
   Finite-dimensional Hilbert space.

5. **Discrete-time martingale representation in binomial** (~500 LOC).
   Every Q-martingale is the discrete stochastic integral of a
   predictable process w.r.t. the discounted asset. Constructive.

6. **Optimal-stopping characterisation** (~400 LOC). Snell envelope
   equals `sup_{τ stopping time} E^Q[e^{−rτ} g(S_τ)]`. Requires
   defining stopping times on the binomial path space.

7. **Carr-Madan full integral identity** (~400 LOC). Taylor with
   integral remainder for the log-payoff, expressed as static
   portfolio of OTM puts + calls. Requires `intervalIntegral`
   calculus.

8. **Carr-Lee moment formula** (~600 LOC). Existence of `E[S_T^p]`
   bounded by wing-decay rate of implied vol `σ²(K) · T`. Real-
   analytic, genuinely surprising.

## What this library can *not* become without Mathlib upstream

Honest scope statement:

* **Continuous-time Itô calculus**: Mathlib does not ship a general Itô
  integral at the current pin, so the library builds its own L²-adapted
  integral on `[0,T]` (`itoIntegralCLM_T`) and the bounded-derivative L²
  Itô formula on top of it (`ito_formula_L2_bddDeriv`); Margrabe is
  delivered via change of numéraire. Still out of reach without a fuller
  (localized / unbounded) stochastic-calculus layer: unrestricted-`C²`
  Itô, continuous-time Girsanov, Heston, local volatility, SABR, BSDEs.

* **Continuous Poisson processes**: Mathlib has the discrete
  `PoissonPMF`; continuous-time Poisson processes (interarrival
  exponential, superposition, thinning, Lévy processes) are
  upstream-gated.

* **Fine Brownian path machinery**: reflection principle for BM,
  nowhere-differentiability of BM paths, law of iterated logarithm —
  these need path-level machinery beyond what's currently in
  Mathlib's `BrownianMotion`.

The library can be excellent without these. It cannot be "complete"
mathematical finance without them.

## Conclusion

The path to "the formalization library that defines what mathematical finance
looks like in Lean/Mathlib" runs through structural depth, not theorem
count. Three depth theorems plus continued slop-folding plus honest
documentation get us a coherent library that a quant practitioner would
respect. They do not get us to Tao level — that requires original
mathematics, which is a different project.

# mathematical-finance roadmap (unblocked path)

the 16 remaining `reduced_core` theorems in `docs/coverage.md` are upstream-gated on the itô integral, measure-change machinery, and continuous-time poisson processes. this document captures what can be built **without** waiting on upstream mathlib or degenne work, framed as a mathematical-finance project rather than a textbook audit.

all of it either (a) reuses the existing `bsd1`/`bsd2`/`Phi`/`bs_identity`/`hasDerivAt_Phi`/`bsV` infrastructure, (b) is a parallel construction to black-scholes using the same gaussian machinery, or (c) is discrete-time / classical-analysis material that doesn't touch the itô integral.

## phase 1: complete the static black-scholes world (DONE 2026-05-18)

all six items shipped in a single session. all axioms-clean; all benchmarked as `full` in `benchmarks/mathematical_finance.json`.

- [x] **black-scholes put formula** — `BlackScholesPut.lean`. derived by direct integration on the left tail (`integral_exp_mul_gaussianPDFReal_Iic` primitive). put-call parity proved as corollary.
- [x] **vega**: `∂V/∂σ = S · ϕ(d_1) · √τ` — `BlackScholesPDE.lean` (extended). magic identity collapses both `∂_σ d_1` chain-rule contributions.
- [x] **rho**: `∂V/∂r = K · τ · e^{-rτ} · Φ(d_2)` — `BlackScholesPDE.lean` (extended). same magic-identity collapse.
- [x] **cash-or-nothing digital option** — `BlackScholesDigital.lean`. direct integration on `Ioi(-d_2)`.
- [x] **asset-or-nothing digital option** — `BlackScholesDigital.lean`. plus call decomposition `C = AssetDigital − K · CashDigital` as corollary.
- [x] **forward and futures pricing** under no-arbitrage — `BlackScholesForward.lean`. derived from Gaussian MGF; also gives the discounted-asset martingale property `E_Q[e^{-rT} S_T] = S_0`.

milestone DONE: complete BS sensitivities (delta + gamma in `BlackScholesPDE.lean`, plus vega + theta + rho) plus the full vanilla european product set (call, put, 2 digitals, forward).

## phase 2: vanilla derivatives theory complete (DONE 2026-05-18)

all three items shipped in the same session as phase 1. all axioms-clean; all `full` in `benchmarks/mathematical_finance.json`.

- [x] **bachelier model option pricing** — `BachelierModel.lean` (~330 lines). key new primitive: the **truncated mean of N(0, 1)** `∫_a^∞ z ϕ(z) dz = ϕ(a)`, proved via FTC `integral_Ioi_of_hasDerivAt_of_tendsto` with antiderivative `-ϕ` (and `(-ϕ)' = z · ϕ`). also includes the volume-integrability of `z · ϕ(z)` via withDensity transfer from `Integrable id (gaussianReal 0 1)`.
- [x] **implied volatility uniqueness via vega-positivity** — `ImpliedVolatility.lean`. uses `bsV_vega_pos` + `strictMonoOn_of_deriv_pos` + `StrictMonoOn.injOn`.
- [x] **black formula for futures options** — `BlackFutures.lean`. specialization of `bs_call_formula` with `r = 0` (zero drift for futures) plus independent discount.

milestone DONE: rigorous theory of vanilla derivatives. covers the standard closed-form option pricing models taught in a quant program.

## phase 3: discrete-continuous bridge (PARTIAL 2026-05-18, deeper progress same day)

- [x] **discrete-time binomial tree pricing framework** — `BinomialModel.lean`. includes:
  - risk-neutral up-probability `crrUpProb u d r = (e^r − d)/(u − d)` + no-arbitrage condition `BinomialNoArb` + `(0, 1)`-range proof.
  - single-period option price `binomialOptionPriceOnePeriod`.
  - **replicating-portfolio theorems** (cost, up-state payoff, down-state payoff) — three full proofs.
  - multi-period `binomialPrice` via well-founded recursion on remaining steps; one-step consistency lemma; linearity and scalar-homogeneity in the payoff; constant-payoff price closed form `e^{-rn} · c`.
- [x] **CRR parameterization + classical-analytic limit core** — `BinomialCRRConvergence.lean`.
  - CRR parameterization: `crrUp = e^{σ√Δt}`, `crrDown = e^{−σ√Δt}`, `crrPerStepRate = rΔt`, `crrProb` definitions.
  - one-step risk-neutral martingale identity (exact algebraic): `p_n · u_n + (1 − p_n) · d_n = e^{rΔt}`.
  - exponential difference-quotient limits: `(e^{cx}−1)/x → c`, `(e^{c·h²}−1)/h² → c`, `(e^{c·h²}−1)/h → 0`, `(e^{σh} − e^{−σh})/h → 2σ`. all proved via `HasDerivAt` + `hasDerivAt_iff_tendsto_slope`.
  - **`crrProb_tendsto_half`**: `p_n → 1/2` as `n → ∞`. the substantive analytic step — `p_n` becomes asymptotically symmetric Bernoulli. ~80 lines, uses quotient-of-limits + composition with `h_n = √(T/n)`.
  - **`crr_variance_limit`**: `4 σ² T · p_n (1 − p_n) → σ² T`. direct corollary.
- [x] **full pricing-convergence theorem**: `binomialPrice → bs_call_price` as `n → ∞` — **DONE** via route (b): characteristic functions + Lévy's continuity theorem on the log-returns (`binomialPrice_call_tendsto_bs`, `Binomial/CRRCharFun.lean`). No triangular-array CLT needed — the bounded *put* payoff converges weakly directly and put-call parity lifts it to the call. The literal closed form `S₀Φ(d₁) − Ke^{−rT}Φ(d₂)` is `binomialPrice_call_tendsto_bs_closed` (`Binomial/CRRClosedForm.lean`).

milestone (achieved): the CRR↔BS correspondence is complete — the variance limit, `p_n → 1/2`, the drift limit `n · (2 p_n − 1) · σ√Δt → (r − σ²/2) T` (`crr_drift_limit_n`, `DriftLimit.lean`), and full distributional + price-level convergence to the BS closed form (`binomialPrice_call_tendsto_bs` / `…_closed`).

## phase 4: upstream foundations

real upstream contributions that would land in mathlib or degenne. each is a separate PR. all four items are ready to submit; awaiting an upstream-PR session.

- [ ] **`Real.erf` for mathlib**. mathlib has no error function. drafting it would unlock cleaner standard-normal-CDF APIs across this project and the broader probability ecosystem. ~300 lines plus the `Real.erfc`, `Real.erfinv` companions and basic identities. would also let us replace our local `Phi` definition with `(1 + erf(x/√2))/2`. **status**: not yet drafted; multi-day work.
- [x] **`gaussianReal_Iic_hasDerivAt` for mathlib**: proved as `hasDerivAt_Phi` in `MathFin/GaussianCDFDeriv.lean` (~80 lines via FTC). ready to upstream as a separate PR (`Φ' = ϕ` is the missing piece).
- [x] **mathlib PR (drafted in `staging/mathlib-pr/`)**: the 4 gaussian tail / completing-the-square lemmas. ready to submit.
- [x] **degenne PR (drafted in `staging/degenne-pr/`)**: the two BM martingales `IsFilteredPreBrownian.squareSubTime_isMartingale` and `IsFilteredPreBrownian.waldExponential_isMartingale`. ready to submit.

## explicitly out of scope (itô-gated, do not attempt without upstream)

these wait on mathlib developing the itô integral or on degenne's brownian-motion library:

- girsanov theorem
- novikov's condition
- martingale representation theorem
- itô's lemma (general SDE chain rule)
- time-dependent itô / 2D itô
- SDE existence/uniqueness
- local martingales / semimartingales
- quadratic variation as a process (we have it as a one-shot at fixed `t`)
- stochastic vol models (heston, SABR)
- jump-diffusion models (merton, kou)
- local volatility (dupire)
- barrier options requiring first-passage time distributions for BM
- quanto / multi-currency options requiring measure change

if mathlib lands an itô integral or degenne extends the brownian-motion library with one, revisit this list.

## stretch goals (technically possible, ergonomically painful)

- **margrabe formula** for exchange options. the rigorous derivation requires a change of numéraire (girsanov). but a "given the right pricing measure, derive the formula" version is achievable using existing gaussian machinery. would need careful scope statement.
- **constant-elasticity-of-variance (CEV) model closed forms**. some special cases have closed forms involving non-central chi-squared distributions. mathlib doesn't have non-central chi-squared yet, so this is gated.

## sequencing recommendation

phases 1 + 2 + phase 3 (basic framework) all landed in a single session on 2026-05-18. remaining work:

1. **CRR convergence to BS** (phase 3 continuation) — **DONE**: `binomialPrice_call_tendsto_bs` and the closed-form `…_closed` (characteristic functions + Lévy + put-call parity; no triangular-array CLT needed).
2. **upstream PRs** (phase 4). the 3 already-drafted items are ready to submit. the `Real.erf` PR would be a fresh multi-day drafting effort.

## what done looks like (achieved)

end of 2026-05-18 session:
- **79 total theorems** (was 65 — 14 new in `benchmarks/mathematical_finance.json`)
- **63 delivery-ready** (was 49)
  - **39 `full`** (was 25 — +14 from `mathematical_finance.json`)
  - **24 `library_wrapper`** (unchanged)
- **16 `reduced_core`** (unchanged; itô-gated)
- **0 `placeholders`** (unchanged)

the project now contains the most thoroughly formalized treatment of static vanilla derivatives pricing in lean 4 known to the author. it's still niche; the audience is still small. but it's a coherent, complete artifact for the "static" world of black-scholes — call, put, parity, both digitals, forward, vega, rho (delta + gamma + theta were already there), bachelier, implied-vol uniqueness, black-76, and the single-period binomial replication theorem.

## the leaps (2026-05-23) — beyond the static world

three "big leaps" pushed past the static ceiling. full narrative in
[`leaps.md`](leaps.md); per-theorem audit in [`coverage.md`](coverage.md).

- **leap 1 — static Girsanov.** the risk-neutral measure is now *derived* from
  the physical measure via an Esscher density (`GaussianGirsanov.lean`,
  `BSCallHyp.exists_of_physical`). `BSCallHyp` — assumed by 14 pricing files —
  is a theorem. axioms-clean.
- **leap 2 — genesis cascade.** `discounted_terminal_eq_S0_of_physical` proves
  the constructed `Q` is a genuine EMM; `bs_call_formula_of_physical` runs the
  full physical→price chain. additive bridges, `GaussianGirsanov` load-bearing.
- **leap 3 — multivariate (Margrabe).** the exchange option, first multivariate
  result: effective vol, `GarmanNormalForm` slot-in, parity, and the
  price-level reduction (`margrabe_price_via_call`: exchange = `bs_call_formula`
  on the ratio). `ExchangeOption.lean`.

all build-enforced axioms-clean via `MathFin/AxiomAudit.lean`.

### leap 4 — the adapted Itô isometry (done, discrete) + the continuous frontier

the increment-independence this was long said to wait on is **not** WIP: it is
`IsPreBrownian.hasIndepIncrements` / `IsPreBrownian.indepFun_shift`, fully
proven in Degenne's package. Building directly on it:

- **leap 4 (discrete) — done.** `Foundations/ItoIsometryAdapted.lean`: the Itô
  isometry for *adapted random* simple integrands,
  `E[(Σ φₖ·ΔBₖ)²] = Σ E[φₖ²]·(t_{k+1}−t_k)` (`ito_isometry_discrete`). the
  cross-terms vanish by the weak Markov property (`ΔBₖ ⊥ 𝓕_{tₖ}`), **not** by
  deterministic covariance — that distinction *is* what separates the Itô
  integral from the Wiener integral (`WienerIntegralL2.lean`, deterministic
  integrands). capstone: the fully-discharged `∫₀ᵀ B dB` Riemann-sum isometry
  `ito_isometry_brownian_self`. build-enforced axioms-clean.
- **continuous integral — done on `[0,T]`.** the L²(adapted) Cauchy completion
  over adapted processes (density of adapted simple integrands in the adapted
  L²) is **built**: `itoIntegralCLM_T` (`ItoIntegralCLM.lean`), with
  `∫₀ᵀ B dB = ½(B_T²−B₀²−T)` as its first consumer. what remains is the
  downstream pathwise Itô / Lévy / SDE layer (the infinite-horizon
  `L2Predictable` variant is now done — `itoIntegralL2`,
  `ito-integral-clm-deferred.md`).
- **Margrabe `BSCallHyp`-grounding — done.** `MargrabeGrounding.lean`: the
  ratio's risk-neutral lognormality is *derived* from a joint two-GBM gaussian
  model (`normalizedSpread_hasLaw_std` + `margrabe_bsCallHyp_of_gaussian`),
  reducing to leap-1 Girsanov on the single effective driver. closes leap 3
  end-to-end; makes `Foundations/BivariateGaussian` load-bearing.

these are honest dedicated builds, not bolt-ons. a hypothesis-form Itô isometry
was drafted and **reverted** earlier precisely because its orthogonality
hypothesis had no available discharge; leap 4 (discrete) is now the genuine
discharge of exactly that orthogonality, via the weak Markov property — the
no-slop line, held.

## the continuous L²(adapted) Itô integral on `[0,T]` — DONE

**Built (2026-05-30):** `itoIntegralCLM_T` (`Foundations/ItoIntegralCLM.lean`),
the continuous linear isometry on `[0,T]`, axioms-clean and AxiomAudit-pinned,
with `∫₀ᵀ B dB = ½(B_T²−B₀²−T)` (`ItoIntegralBrownian.lean`) as its first
consumer. The construction sketch below is kept as a reference record of how it
was built; the still-open downstream layer is the pathwise Itô / Lévy / SDE
results (the infinite-horizon `L2Predictable` variant is now done —
`itoIntegralL2`, `ito-integral-clm-deferred.md`).

**Goal.** A continuous linear isometry
`itoIntegralL2 : {adapted L²(Ω×[0,T])} →L[ℝ] Lp ℝ 2 μ` extending the discrete
`ito_isometry_discrete`, with `‖itoIntegralL2 φ‖² = ∫₀ᵀ E[φ_t²] dt`.

**Construction (mirror the Wiener case, but the integrand space is adapted).**
1. Space of *adapted simple processes*: `φ = Σₖ Hₖ · 𝟙_{(tₖ,tₖ₊₁]}` with each
   `Hₖ` `𝓕_{tₖ}`-measurable + `L²` (reuse `AdaptedAt` / `pastProcess`).
2. The isometry on simple processes **is** `ito_isometry_discrete` (already
   built) — that is the algebraic core, done.
3. **The genuinely new work**: density of adapted simple processes in the
   adapted `L²` space `L²_𝓕(Ω×[0,T])`. The Wiener proof's orthogonal-complement
   route (`stepAssembly_denseRange`) does **not** transfer directly — the
   integrand is jointly measurable in `(ω,t)` and the simple processes must be
   *adapted*, so the dense-subspace argument runs in the closed subspace of
   progressively-measurable `L²` functions, not all of `L²`. This is the crux
   and the bulk of the effort.
4. `LinearMap.extendOfNorm` then yields the CLM, exactly as `wienerIntegralLp`.

**Prerequisite to check first**: whether Degenne's `StochasticIntegral/`
tree (predictable processes, `BrownianMotion/StochasticIntegral/`) already
supplies the adapted-`L²` density or the progressive-measurability scaffolding
— if so, this reduces to a wrapper + the discrete isometry and is much smaller.
Reconnoitre that tree before building from scratch.

**Unblocks**: the ~12 itô-gated `reduced_core`s (Itô's lemma path-wise form,
time-dependent Itô, SDE existence/uniqueness, the general Girsanov entries) —
each becomes a real consumer of `itoIntegralL2`, finally making the Itô layer
load-bearing into the pricing modules rather than a standalone cornerstone.

**Out of scope / still genuinely gated** (do not conflate with the above):
continuous-time Poisson processes (Cox/Credit), BM reflection principle,
nowhere-differentiability, and the law of iterated logarithm — none are
unblocked by the Itô integral; they need their own upstream Mathlib
infrastructure. (CRR→BS distributional convergence is **done** — via
characteristic functions + put-call parity, sidestepping the triangular-array
CLT.)

## phase: the 100%-full push — Poisson cluster + Itô QV (2026-06-05)

The remaining gap to 100% full is 22 reduced cores in four clusters
(Poisson 4, Markov 6, Itô/Girsanov tower 9, BM path machinery 3). This
phase took the Poisson cluster and the bounded half of the Itô pair.

**Poisson cluster (4 entries) — landed:**

- `pp-thm-3.3.9` (superposition) → **full**. New
  `Foundations/PoissonSuperposition.lean`: the Poisson convolution identity
  `poissonMeasure a ∗ poissonMeasure b = poissonMeasure (a+b)` (absent from
  Mathlib; singleton-ext + binomial collapse of the Cauchy product) + the
  independent-sum bridge mirroring `gaussianReal_conv_gaussianReal`'s
  pattern.
- `pp-thm-3.3.10` (thinning) → **full**. New
  `Foundations/PoissonThinning.lean`: the binomial-marking factorisation
  `markedPoissonMeasure r p = Poisson(pr) ×ₘ Poisson((1−p)r)` — marginals
  AND independence of the thinned streams derived from the marking
  mechanism (`C(j+k,j)/(j+k)! = 1/(j!k!)` + `e^{−r} = e^{−pr}e^{−qr}`).
- `pp-thm-3.3.5` (marginal law) → **full**, via the route coverage.md
  recorded as re-earnable. New `Foundations/PoissonCounting.lean`: marginal
  derived from the arrival construction — Erlang law of arrival times
  (`ErlangSum`, generalized from `Fin n` to arbitrary index) composed with
  the new **Gamma-CDF difference identity**
  `∫₀ᵗ γ_k − ∫₀ᵗ γ_{k+1} = e^{−rt}(rt)ᵏ/k!` (FTC telescope on
  `Φ_k(u) = (ru)ᵏe^{−ru}/k!`).
- `pp-prop-3.3.6` (interarrivals iid Exp) → stays **reduced_core,
  honestly**, but with a real derived core. New
  `Foundations/PoissonInterarrival.lean`: the FIRST interarrival is PROVED
  exponential from the counting axioms (survival law + CDF identification
  against `cdf_expMeasure_eq`), and the memoryless survival factorisation
  is PROVED from independent increments. The full-sequence iid claim needs
  the strong Markov property — upstream-gated.

**Itô bounded pair:**

- `sc-thm-7.4.5` (QV of an Itô process) → **full** in the constant-σ /
  Lipschitz-drift regime. New `Foundations/ItoProcessQV.lean`: equipartition
  QV sums of `X = X₀ + A + σB` converge in L² to `σ²T` with explicit `1/n`
  rates — the drift-immunity content derived (pathwise squeeze + Cauchy–
  Schwarz cross-term + `QuadraticVariationL2`). General σ(s,ω) = Summit B.
- `sc-thm-7.1.2` (time-dependent Itô) → **full** (2026-06-07, Summit A′
  DONE). The assessed mini-campaign executed as scoped: the three Summit-A
  limit arguments redone with `(t,x)`-dependence. `tendsto_weighted_qv_process`
  (WeightedQuadraticVariation generalized to bounded *adapted weight
  processes* — the fluctuation engine never cared the weight was `g(B_s)`;
  `tendsto_riemann_L2_process` exported standalone for the drift term),
  `tendsto_ito_remainder_td` (2D Taylor remainder, `O(1/n)` under
  `E[ΔB⁶] = 15Δt³`), `itoIntegralCLM_T_of_bdd_cont_td` (TD Riemann↔CLM
  bridge), assembled in `Foundations/ItoFormulaTD.lean`:
  `ito_formula_td_L2_bddDeriv` = the classical
  `f(T,B_T) − f(0,B₀) = ∫f_x dB + ∫(f_t + ½f_xx) ds` a.e., with `f_t`'s
  joint continuity *derived* from its bounded partials. Unbounded
  coefficients stay the named gap (as in 7.1.1).

**Markov cluster note:** `Kernel.traj` (Ionescu–Tulcea) is now IN the
Mathlib pin — re-cost the path-space entries (`mc-thm-1.1.2`,
`mc-thm-1.4.32`) before assuming they are gated.

**Follow-up (small): adopt `formalization.yaml`** — the mathlib-initiative
formalization-provenance manifest (scope / sources / sorry count / axiom
boundary / paper↔Lean alignment / production record). The repo already
maintains every ingredient (formalization_status, coverage.md, AxiomAudit,
verification ledger); a stdlib generator emitting one repo-level manifest
from the benchmark JSONs would make it legible to the emerging standard.

## phase: the finance layer over the Poisson/QV track (2026-06-06)

The 2026-06-05 round derived the Poisson/QV foundations; this phase answers
"what, in finance, did that free" by making them load-bearing in the
pricing layer. Six new `full` entries (corpus 261 → 267, **231 full + 18
wrappers = 249/267 delivery-ready**), four new modules, recon-first (two
Explore agents + daemon name-probes before any Lean was written; three of
four modules green on first daemon check, the fourth needed two mechanical
fixes — a `Phi_nonneg` name collision and a needless `Summable.congr`).

- **Variance-swap drift immunity** (`mf-variance-swap-drift-immunity`,
  `Foundations/VarianceSwapDriftImmunity.lean`): realized variance of GBM
  log-returns → `σ²T` in **L²** for ANY drift — the fair strike is a QV
  functional; physical-vs-risk-neutral drift is irrelevant to what the
  swap settles on. First pricing consumer of `ItoProcessQV`; strengthens
  phase 34 (expectation-level, risk-neutral-drift-only) on both axes.
- **First-to-default additivity** (`mf-first-to-default-spread`,
  `FixedIncome/FirstToDefault.lean`): FtD basket spread = Σ single-name
  hazards under independence. Pure de-orphaning bridge:
  `ExpMin.minimum_survival` (previously consumed only by `dist-exp-min`)
  rewritten in `Credit.lean` vocabulary; spread reading via the existing
  `creditSpread_eq_hazard`. No new measure theory.
- **Poisson pgf** (`dist-poisson-pgf`, `Foundations/PoissonPgf.lean`):
  `E[x^N] = e^{r(x−1)}` for every real `x`, absent from Mathlib —
  exponential series at `r·x` rescaled by `e^{−r}`, the same
  `NormedSpace.expSeries_div_hasSum_exp` route Mathlib uses for the pmf
  normalisation.
- **Merton (1976) jump-diffusion** (`mf-merton-call-series` /
  `mf-merton-spot-recombination` / `mf-merton-put-call-parity`,
  `BlackScholes/MertonJumpDiffusion.lean`): the price is *defined* as
  `∫ n, C_BS(spot_n, vol_n) ∂(poissonMeasure Λ)` — an honest expectation
  over the jump count (the pin's `integral_poissonMeasure` makes the
  textbook series a theorem, not a definition). Compensation identity
  `E[spot_N] = S₀` via the pgf at `1+k`; parity through the mixture via
  sandwich-bound integrability (`0 ≤ C_n ≤ spot_n`, `0 ≤ P_n ≤ Ke^{−rT}`)
  + term-wise `Φ(x)+Φ(−x)=1` algebra. Every term separately grounded as a
  discounted conditional expected payoff (`bs_call_formula` instantiated
  on `(ℝ, gaussianReal 0 1)` with `HasLaw.id`). Honest scope: terminal
  mixture law only, exactly parallel to `BSCallHyp`; the compound-Poisson
  jump *SDE* stays upstream-gated.

**Deliberately skipped:** Cramér–Lundberg ruin bound (needs
compound-Poisson process machinery + optional stopping we don't have —
only the algebraic MGF identity exists in `Actuarial/Mortality.lean`);
jump-diffusion QV with compound-Poisson jumps (same gating).

**Next candidates from here:** Merton Greeks / monotonicity-in-Λ
(formula-level, cheap); re-pointing the λ′ = Λ(1+k) classic display as a
series-rearrangement lemma; the Markov cluster re-cost (`Kernel.traj`);
Summit B decision.

## phase: merton dominance + classic display + markov path law (2026-06-06, second round)

the "next candidates" above, executed, plus the markov re-cost verdict.

- **merton dominance** (`mf-merton-dominance`,
  `BlackScholes/MertonDominance.lean` + `BlackScholes/SpotConvexity.lean`):
  `C_BS(S₀,σ) ≤ C_Merton(S₀,σ,k,δ,Λ)` for every `Λ`, `δ`, `k > −1` — the
  "Merton Greeks" item reframed to its substantive content. a literal
  delta-as-series theorem needs differentiation under the tsum, whose
  global derivative bounds the junk region `s ≤ 0` cannot honestly supply
  (`hasDerivAt_tsum` requires them) — skipped as ceremony. the dominance
  bound prices the two jump channels separately: per-term vol-monotonicity
  (vega, `bsV_strictMonoOn_sigma`) reduces to `δ = 0`; there the **new
  spot-direction convexity** `bsV_spot_convexOn` (gamma ≥ 0
  second-derivative test — the S-direction dual of `bsV_strike_convexOn`,
  so convexity is now visible in both coordinates of the price surface)
  gives the supporting tangent at `S₀`, whose linear term integrates to
  zero by the compensation identity `integral_mertonSpot`.
- **classic display** (`mf-merton-classic-display`,
  `BlackScholes/MertonClassicDisplay.lean`): the textbook `Λ′ = Λ(1+k)`
  series with shifted rates `r_n = r − kΛ/T + n·log(1+k)/T`, driven by one
  structural identity — the rate-shift invariance
  `bsV K r σ (S·e^{cτ}) τ = e^{cτ}·bsV K (r+c) σ S τ`
  (`bsV_spot_exp_rate_shift`) — plus Poisson-weight absorption.
- **markov re-cost verdict** (`Kernel.traj` now in the pin): only
  `mc-thm-1.1.2` was genuinely unlocked, and it is now **full**
  (`Foundations/MarkovPathMeasure.lean`): the chain's law is constructed
  via `Kernel.trajMeasure` from kernels that read only the last history
  coordinate, and the path factorization is derived by induction through
  the comp-product recursion of the marginals. the other five Markov
  reduced cores stay honestly gated — recurrence needs renewal theory /
  fundamental-matrix algebra, convergence to stationarity needs
  Perron–Frobenius, the ergodic theorem needs both plus aperiodicity,
  stationary uniqueness needs recurrence + communicating classes, and the
  strong Markov property needs stopping-time kernels (a design-level
  extension, not a gap-fill). a markov campaign is a 4–6 week
  renewal+spectral build, upstream-quality material — record, don't drift
  into it. *re-confirmed 2026-06-06 (third round), with one new datum:
  the pin now carries `Matrix.IsIrreducible` / `Matrix.IsPrimitive`
  **definitions** (`LinearAlgebra/Matrix/Irreducible/Defs.lean`,
  quiver-path formulation + `isIrreducible_iff_exists_pow_pos`) but no
  Perron–Frobenius eigenvalue theorem, and `Dynamics/BirkhoffSum` is the
  von-Neumann normed-space flavor, not the pointwise ergodic theorem. the
  re-cost trigger for 1.4.25/1.4.40 is therefore concrete: when Mathlib
  lands the PF theorem over these definitions, both become tractable
  matrix-level builds.*

**Next candidates from here:** Summit B decision (integral-as-process /
general `σ(s,ω)`); hammer re-pilot at the rc2→stable toolchain bump; the
Markov renewal/spectral layers if that cluster is ever prioritized.
(`sc-thm-7.1.2` time-dependent Itô: DONE 2026-06-07 — Summit A′ landed, see
the Itô bounded pair above.)

## phase: Feynman–Kac → Black–Scholes PDE keystone (2026-06-08)

the second, **Itô-independent** derivation that the discounted risk-neutral
price solves the Black–Scholes PDE — closing the "two-tower" gap (the deep
Itô tower had no pricing consumer; the heat-flow `feynmanU` was an orphan).
this is the direction recorded as "deferred — not needed ever" in
`docs/feynman-kac-growth-deferred.md`, now **revived and completed** (that
note carries a superseded banner).

- **the heat-flow engine** (`Foundations/FeynmanKacHeatEquation.lean`): the
  heat kernel `K(t,y) = (√(2πt))⁻¹ e^{−y²/2t}` is **jointly Fréchet-
  differentiable** (`hasFDerivAt_heatKernel`) — the one genuinely-2D
  ingredient, so a single curve chain rule serves all three partials.
  `hasDerivAt_feynmanU_{t,x,xx}` differentiate `feynmanU g t x = ∫ z, g z ·
  K(t, z−x) dz` under the integral (dominated convergence, routed through the
  parametric skeleton `hasDerivAt_integral_mul_kernelFamily`; `g` need only be
  continuous + growth-controlled, so the call's kink is sidestepped). the
  kernel identity `feynmanU_heat_equation` is `∂_t K = ½ ∂_xx K`.
- **the keystone** (`BlackScholes/PDEFromFeynmanKac.lean`,
  `bsV_satisfies_bs_pde_via_feynmanKac`): the BS Greeks
  `hasDerivAt_bsV_{tau,S,SS}_fk` follow from the heat flow by the log-
  transform `S = eˣ` + discount `e^{−r(T−t)}`; the BS PDE assembles by exact
  drift cancellation (`U_x` coeff `−(r−σ²/2)−½σ²+r = 0`, `U_xx` coeff
  `−½σ²+½σ²=0`). the ∂_τ wall (the uniform-domination `nlinarith`/200k-
  heartbeat blow-up that defeated several earlier attempts) fell by isolating
  the polynomial bracket bounds as standalone lemmas with the moving
  denominator replaced by the constant `v₀`, and dominating by a **sum of two
  Gaussian-moment envelopes** (one per kernel-derivative term) rather than a
  single mega-constant.
- **wired**: corpus entry `sc-bs-pde-feynman-kac` (`full`); the
  `sc-thm-9.2.1` scope note de-staled (its "~300–500 lines upstream" claim
  was false — the infra is built and consumed). bridge row "FK" in
  `bridges.md`. counts: corpus 269→**270**, full 235→**236**, delivery-ready
  **254**/270.

**scope honesty:** this is the **constant-coefficient** (closed-form) case.
the genuinely-open FK work is **variable-coefficient** (`σ(S,t)` local vol,
Heston) on the general-Itô/SDE layer — a different, much harder theorem — plus
the fully-general continuous-`g` PDE + uniqueness.

**Next candidates from here:** ✅ the round-5 deferred cleanup was executed
same-day (orphan wiring + blueprint spine + the `sc-thm-8.2.5` rewrite,
`3a25518`/`bde8f24`; values round 6 then found that rewrite's uniqueness
clause uninhabitable and repaired it with an opaque integral-*operator*
encoding + an in-snippet inhabitant guard). Remaining: P1 the explicit
CRR→BS error-constant paper.

## phase: Summit B / B1b — the general-integrand Itô integral (2026-06-12)

B1a built the elementary (simple-integrand) Itô integral as a process; B1b
extends it to a **general** predictable integrand `φ ∈ L2Predictable[0,T]` (=
Degenne's predictable-L² on `[0,T]`), delivering the general Itô integral
`(φ●B)_t = ∫₀ᵗ φ dB` as a **continuous L² martingale on `[0,T]`**
(`Foundations/ItoIntegralProcessGeneral.lean`).

- **Architecture (direct extension).** `itoProcessCLM := itoProcessLM.extendOfNorm
  simpleAssembly_T` — extend B1a's t-process linear map along the *same* dense
  embedding that builds the terminal CLM `itoIntegralCLM_T`. The bridge to B1a is
  then **definitional** (`extendOfNorm_eq`); the one new analytic input is the
  contraction bound `‖(V●B)_t‖ ≤ ‖V‖`, from B1a's martingale + the condExp L²
  contraction.
- **The key identity** `itoProcessCLM_eq_condExpL2`: `(φ●B)_t = condExpL2 𝓕_t
  (∫₀ᵀ φ dB)` (the integral is the conditional-expectation projection of its
  terminal value). From it: the **martingale property** (condExp tower
  `condExp_condExp_of_le`), **a.e.-adaptedness** (`condExpL2` lands in `lpMeas`),
  the **contraction** `‖(φ●B)_t‖ ≤ ‖φ‖`, and the **terminal isometry**
  `‖(φ●B)_T‖ = ‖φ‖` (`itoProcessCLM T T = itoIntegralCLM_T T`). **L²-continuity**
  is uniform approximation: the t-free contraction makes the simple-process
  processes converge uniformly in `t`, so the limit is continuous
  (`TendstoUniformly.continuous`).
- **Coherence (the bump's payoff).** Pure consumption of upstream (Degenne's
  `L2Predictable`/`SimpleProcess`, Mathlib's `condExpL2`/`extendOfNorm`/condExp
  tower) + the repo's B1a + `itoIntegralCLM_T`. Nothing reproved.
- **Wired:** 3 new `full` entries (`sc-ito-general-martingale` /
  `-terminal-isometry` / `-l2-continuity`); corpus 277 → **280**, 242 → **245
  full**; lake build 8723 jobs green, axioms-clean; values panel PASS (one
  docstring-honesty blocker fixed).

**Honest scope:** finite-horizon `[0,T]`, L² sense.

**Isometry round (2026-06-12) — DONE.** The explicit **time-indexed isometry**
`E[(φ●B)_t²] = ∫₀ᵗ E[φ²] ds` (B1b's deferred refinement) is now **proved**
(`itoProcessCLM_norm_sq`, `Foundations/ItoIntegralProcessIsometry.lean`, entry
`sc-ito-general-time-isometry`). The band-over-trimmed-measure computation
(`restrict`∘`trim`∘`prod` rectTerm integral mirroring `simpleProcessL2_norm_sq`)
gives the band-restricted **simple-process** isometry; the per-endpoint-`∧t`-truncated
double sum (B1a's `itoSimpleProcess_isometry_time`) equals the joint-overlap-`∩(0,t]`
double sum by a pure-ℝ interval-length identity (`band_overlap_real`). It transfers to
all predictable `φ` by `DenseRange.equalizer`: both `‖(φ●B)_t‖²` and
`∫_{(0,t]}φ² = ‖truncCLM φ‖²` (the band-truncation CLM, hand-built — Mathlib has only
the *constant*-indicator `indicatorConstLp`, not variable-`φ` multiplication) are
continuous and agree on the dense simple processes. The generic `lp_two_norm_sq` was
de-privatised in `ItoIntegralL2` and reused. corpus 280 → **281**, 245 → **246 full**;
lake build 8724 jobs green, axioms-clean. **B2 (infinite-horizon `[0,∞)` via
σ-finite predictable exhaustion) DONE 2026-06-13** — `itoIntegralL2` /
`itoIntegralL2_norm` in `Foundations/ItoIntegralL2Dense.lean`, corpus entry
`sc-ito-infinite-horizon-isometry`, by reducing each finite frame to the
finite-horizon `setIntegral_eq_zero_of_orthogonal_pred` via
`trimMeasure_T_eq_restrict` and patching over the `{0}×univ`-null complement;
build 8725 jobs green, axioms-clean, corpus 281 → **282**, 246 → **247 full**.

**B3 (localization) DONE 2026-06-13** — the elementary Itô integral as a
**continuous local martingale** (`itoSimpleProcess_isLocalMartingale` +
`itoSimpleProcess_pathContinuous`, `Foundations/ItoIntegralProcessLocalMartingale.lean`,
entry `sc-ito-simple-process-local-martingale`). The first sample-path
regularity result in the tower: given continuous Brownian paths, `t ↦ (V●B)_t ω`
is continuous (finite sum of continuous clamped increments via
`itoSimpleProcess_apply`), hence càdlàg, so B1a's true `L²` martingale lands in
Degenne's sorry-free `IsLocalMartingale` class (`Martingale.IsLocalMartingale`).
Pure consumption; the genuinely new content is the pathwise continuity. Honest
scope: simple integrands, continuity assumed (the standard pathwise setting;
`IsPreBrownian` fixes only finite-dim laws, a continuous version exists by
Kolmogorov–Chentsov). build 8726 jobs green, axioms-clean, corpus 282 →
**283**, 247 → **248 full**.

**D1 (covariation / bilinear Itô isometry) DONE 2026-06-23** — the polarized
companion of the Itô isometry. `Foundations/ItoIntegralCovariation.lean`, entry
`sc-ito-covariation-bilinear-isometry`. The `[0,T]` Itô CLM is bundled as a
`LinearIsometry` (`itoIsometry_T`, from the norm isometry `itoIntegralCLM_T_norm`);
a real linear norm-isometry preserves the inner product (polarization), so
`LinearIsometry.inner_map_map` gives `⟪∫φ dB, ∫ψ dB⟫ = ⟪φ, ψ⟫`
(`inner_itoIntegralCLM_T`), and `L2.inner_def` unfolds the μ-side to the
expectation `𝔼[(∫φ dB)(∫ψ dB)] = ⟪φ, ψ⟫` (`covariation_itoIntegralCLM_T`); the
diagonal `φ = ψ` recovers the isometry (`variance_itoIntegralCLM_T`). Pure
polarization of B1's norm isometry — the covariance backbone for
covariance/correlation-swap pricing. build 8727 jobs green, axioms-clean, corpus
→ **285**, **250 full** + 18 = 268/285 delivery-ready, 17 reduced.

**Next — D2 (general-integrand local martingale), scoped multi-session.** Recon
this round showed the natural "extend B3 to general integrands" step is GATED:
B1b's general integral exists only as `Lp`/L²-objects (martingale = conditional-
expectation equalities, continuity = L²-continuity into `Lp 2 μ`), with no
pathwise-continuous representative — but Degenne's `IsLocalMartingale` needs
pathwise càdlàg paths (exactly why B3 worked only for the *simple* process and its
explicit continuous clamped-sum). So D2 first needs a **continuous modification**
of the general integral (Doob L²-maximal inequality → a.s.-uniform limit of the
simple approximants → pathwise-continuous process), after which the local-
martingale property is B3's one-liner. That continuous modification is the load-
bearing prerequisite for localizing the Itô formula
(`ItoFormulaTD.ito_formula_td_L2_bddDeriv`, presently bounded-derivative only) to
unbounded/GBM coefficients — the bridge from the analytic Itô tower to the
drift-algebra pricing tower (`ItoLemma2D`, `PDEFromIto`, `VasicekSDE`).

## phase: FTAP tower (2026-06-24 through 2026-06-26, corpus 285→289)

Three FTAP rungs, each built to `full` standard, ascending from finite to infinite
state space and from scalar to vector excess returns.

- **Rung 1 (finite-Ω multi-period, Harrison–Pliska), corpus 285→287.** `ftap_discrete`
  (`mf-ftap-discrete-complete`, `Foundations/FTAPDiscrete.lean`): for a full-support
  finite probability space and a scalar discounted excess return, no-arbitrage ⟺ ∃ EMM,
  multi-period, finite filtration. Forward: EMM ⟹ NA by martingale-transform telescoping.
  Backward: global geometric Hahn–Banach separation of the attainable-gains subspace from
  the standard simplex, via a reusable kernel `Foundations/ConvexSeparation.lean` (Mazur +
  `Finset` relative-interior certificate). The multi-state single-period biconditional
  `hasEMM_multi_iff_not_hasArbitrage` (`mf-ftap-single-period-complete`) was wired at the
  same time. build 8808 jobs green, axioms-clean, corpus → **287**, **252 full** + 18 =
  270/287 delivery-ready, 17 reduced.

- **Rung 2 (general-Ω one-period scalar, Föllmer–Schied 1.55), corpus 287→288.**
  `ftap_one_period` (`mf-ftap-one-period-general`, `Foundations/FTAPOnePeriod.lean`): for
  an arbitrary probability space and a single scalar `L⁰` excess return `Y`, no-arbitrage
  ⟺ ∃ equivalent martingale measure `Q ~ P` with `E_Q[Y] = 0`. Forward: EMM ⟹ NA
  immediately. Backward: bounded-density reduction (clamp `Y` to `L¹`), scalar NA
  dichotomy (sign analysis on `E_P[Y·1_A]` for each event `A`), two-region balancing
  `withDensity` construction of the EMM density. No Hahn–Banach, no Kreps–Yan — the
  general-Ω step beyond Harrison–Pliska is purely measure-theoretic.
  `isEquivProbMeasure_withDensity` extracted into `Foundations/EquivMeasure.lean` to
  avoid duplication with the d-asset rung. values panel 8/8 PASS. corpus → **288**,
  **253 full** + 18 = 271/288 delivery-ready.

- **Rung 3 (d-asset one-period, Föllmer–Schied 1.6), corpus 288→289.** `ftap_one_period_vector`
  (`mf-ftap-one-period-vector`, `Foundations/FTAPOnePeriodVector.lean`): for any
  finite-dimensional inner-product space `F` (the `ℝᵈ` market is `F = EuclideanSpace ℝ
  (Fin d)`) and an `F`-valued excess return `Y`, no-arbitrage ⟺ ∃ EMM. The explicit
  **Esscher/minimal-divergence** EMM is the minimiser of the convex softplus potential
  `θ ↦ ∫ log(1 + exp⟪θ,Y⟫)`: coercive on `Nᗮ` (the orthogonal complement of the gains
  kernel `N = {θ : ⟪θ,Y⟫ = 0 a.e.}`), so a minimiser on `Nᗮ` is automatically global
  (redundant directions absorbed); the first-order condition (differentiation under the
  integral) yields the strictly-positive bounded density `σ⟨θ₀,Y⟩`. Drops the
  earlier non-redundancy hypothesis. No Hahn–Banach, no L⁰-closedness, no measurable
  selection. values panel 8/8 PASS. build 8817 jobs green, axioms-clean, corpus → **289**,
  **254 full** + 18 = 272/289 delivery-ready, 17 reduced.

**Open rung:** general-Ω multi-period DMW (Dalang–Morton–Willinger). Requires
L⁰-closedness of the attainable-gains set and measurable selection — neither in the
current Mathlib/BrownianMotion pin. This is the M2 crown (see `docs/roadmap.md`
strategy framing); the d-asset one-period case is now closed in full.

## phase: Itô pathwise regularity arc (2026-06-25 through 2026-06-26, corpus 289→292)

The D2 gate identified in the B1b/D1 phase — continuous modification of the
general-integrand Itô integral — is now fully built, and extended to the whole
half-line.

- **Continuous modification on `[0,T]`** (`sc-ito-general-continuous-modification`,
  `exists_continuous_modification_itoProcess`,
  `Foundations/ItoIntegralProcessContinuousModification.lean`, corpus 289→290).
  The L²-valued process `t ↦ (φ●B)_t` admits an a.s.-continuous representative.
  Route: Degenne's continuous-time Doob maximal inequality (applied to the approximating
  simple-process martingales `(V_n●B)_t`) → Chebyshev on the maximal deviation
  → Borel–Cantelli on a fast geometric subsequence → pathwise uniform convergence to a
  continuous limit `itoContinuousMod`. The running-max keystone
  (`itoContinuousMod_sup_le`) bounds the pathwise norm under the supremum over `[0,T]`.
  This is the first sample-path result for the *general* integrand; the bounded-derivative
  Itô formula localization to unbounded coefficients follows from here.
  values panel PASS. build green, axioms-clean, corpus → **290**, **255 full** + 18 =
  273/290 delivery-ready.

- **Continuous local martingale on `[0,T]`** (`sc-ito-general-local-martingale`,
  `exists_continuous_localMartingale_modification`,
  `Foundations/ItoIntegralProcessLocalMartingaleGeneral.lean`, corpus 290→291).
  The continuous modification is upgraded to Degenne's `IsLocalMartingale` interface,
  adapted to the **null-augmented** Brownian filtration `𝓕ᴮ ⊔ 𝓝`. The
  measure-theoretic core is `condExp_sup_nulls`: conditioning on the null augmentation
  agrees a.e. with conditioning on `𝓕ᴮ` (its σ-algebra crux consuming Mathlib's
  `eventuallyMeasurableSpace`); every `(𝓕 ⊔ 𝓝)`-measurable set is a.e. a `𝓕`-set.
  Non-redundant with Degenne's sorry-backed general càdlàg modification (different
  objects: his is a BM modification, ours is an integral-process modification).
  corpus → **291**, **256 full** + 18 = 274/291 delivery-ready.

- **Continuous local martingale on `[0,∞)`** (`sc-ito-infinite-local-martingale`,
  `exists_continuous_localMartingale_modification_infinite`,
  `Foundations/ItoIntegralProcessLocalMartingaleInfinite.lean`, corpus 291→292).
  The per-horizon `[0,T=n]` continuous local martingales are **glued** into one path
  continuous on all of `ℝ≥0`. The key steps: horizon consistency
  (`itoProcessL2Inf_eq_itoProcessCLM`) resting on the band-restriction CLM
  `restrictToBand` and a hand-built `[0,T]` clamp of Degenne's `SimpleProcess`
  (`simpleProcessL2_T`); `indistinguishable_of_modification_on` agrees the
  per-horizon modifications on overlapping windows; with no horizon clamp the
  martingale property is the global `itoProcessL2Inf_isMartingale` via
  `condExp_sup_nulls`. This is the Itô integral as a continuous local martingale on
  the entire time domain `ℝ≥0`. values panel 8/8 PASS. build green, axioms-clean,

## phase: Itô tower → pricing bridge — Vasicek terminal law derived (2026-06-27)

The deepest analytic Itô tower (complete through the `[0,∞)` continuous local
martingale) had **no pricing consumer**; pricing modules touched it only at the
*drift-algebra* level (`ItoLemma`/`ItoLemma2D`). This phase makes the
deterministic-integrand layer load-bearing in a pricing module for the first time.

- **The deterministic-integrand Wiener integral is Gaussian**
  (`sc-wiener-integral-gaussian`, `wienerIntegralLp_map_eq_gaussianReal`,
  `Foundations/WienerIntegralGaussian.lean`). `WienerIntegralL2` built the integral
  as an isometry but pinned only its *norm*; this supplies the *law*:
  `μ.map (wienerIntegralLp B hB T f) = gaussianReal 0 ‖f‖²`. Characteristic-function
  route — simple-process Gaussianity (`IsGaussianProcess.of_isGaussianProcess` +
  `map_eq_gaussianReal`, mean 0 + the isometry as variance) lifted to all `L²` by a
  `|t|`-Lipschitz-charFun `DenseRange.induction_on` + `Measure.ext_of_charFun`.

- **Vasicek terminal law derived** (`mf-vasicek-sde-terminal-gaussian`,
  `vasicekShortRate_hasLaw_gaussian`, `FixedIncome/VasicekSDEGaussian.lean`). The SDE
  solution `r_T = mean + σ ∫₀ᵀ e^{−κ(T−s)} dB_s` has law
  `N(vasicekSDEMean, σ²(1−e^{−2κT})/(2κ))` — the closed form `VasicekSDE.lean` posited
  is now a theorem. Variance via the FTC integral `∫₀ᵀ e^{−2κ(T−s)} ds`; affine
  transport via `gaussianReal_const_mul`/`gaussianReal_const_add`. **First Itô-tower
  consumer in FixedIncome.** corpus 292 → **294**, 257 → **259 full**.

## phase: localized (exponential-growth) Itô formula — the rung-3 unlock to GBM (2026-06-28)

- **Localized time-dependent Itô formula** (`sc-ito-formula-localized`,
  `ito_formula_td_localized`, `Foundations/ItoFormulaLocalized.lean`). Lifts the
  bounded-derivative `ito_formula_td_L2_bddDeriv` (six *global* derivative bounds) to `f` of
  **at-most-exponential growth** `|f_• t x| ≤ C·exp(λ|x|)` — so it reaches the GBM/Black–Scholes
  value function `f(t,x)=S₀ exp((r−σ²/2)t+σx)`, the named out-of-scope gap of 7.1.1/7.1.2.
  Same conclusion shape, a drop-in. The proof is an **L²-cutoff localization that consumes the
  bounded engine**: smooth truncation `SmoothTrunc` = a `ContDiffBump` antiderivative (every
  derivative + bound from Mathlib, no explicit calculus); `cutoff_bddDeriv` applies the bounded
  formula to each `fₙ=f(t,φₙ(x))` via the chain rule; then `n→∞` — boundary (`boundary_tendsto_L2`)
  and drift (`drift_tendsto_L2`) converge in `L²(μ)` by dominated convergence, the dominators
  integrable because Brownian marginals have **every exponential moment** (`BrownianExpMoment`,
  Mathlib's Gaussian MGF transferred along `B_s~N(0,s)`) and the drift dominator is the new
  reusable base stone `pathIntegral_expGrowth_memLp` (exp-growth path integral in `L²`, Fatou
  over Riemann sums + discrete Cauchy–Schwarz, no Tonelli). Hence `aₙ=itoIntegralCLM_T gfxₙ` is
  Cauchy; the Itô **isometry** transfers Cauchy-ness to the integrands `gfxₙ`, completeness gives
  the witness, CLM **continuity** identifies its image with the limit. The deep Itô tower (QV,
  isometry, CLM) carries the pricing weight with zero new analytic machinery beyond the cutoff.
  corpus 294 → **295**, 259 → **260 full**.

- **The Itô tower reaches pricing — GBM decomposed by the Itô integral**
  (`Foundations/ItoFormulaGBM.lean`, entries `sc-ito-formula-gbm`, `sc-discounted-gbm-ito`, both
  `full`). The **first pricing-ward consumer of the analytic Itô tower**, which until now had
  *none*: GBM/BS pricing ran via separate algebraic towers (`ItoLemma`/`PDEFromIto`, Feynman–Kac)
  and `discountedGBM_isMartingale` was proved via the Wald exponential, never the Itô integral.
  `ito_formula_gbm` gives `Ŝ(T) − Ŝ(0) =ᵐ itoIntegralCLM_T gfx + ∫₀ᵀ m·Ŝ ds` for the GBM value
  `Ŝ(t)=S₀ exp((m−σ²/2)t+σ B_t)`, the stochastic term the *genuine* continuous Itô integral. The
  route is the **classic one — localization in time**: the GBM value is `t`-exponential and fails
  the localized formula's `t`-uniform growth, so the localized formula is applied to the
  time-localized exponent `S₀ exp((m−σ²/2)·φₙ(t)+σx)` (`φₙ=SmoothTrunc.cut n`, `n=⌈T⌉₊`), the
  identity on `[0,T]` yet globally bounded so the exp-growth hypotheses hold uniformly in time;
  on `[0,T]` `φₙ=id`, `φₙ'=1`, so the localization drift `(m−σ²/2)·Ŝ` and the Itô correction
  `½σ²·Ŝ` collapse to `m·Ŝ`. Setting `m=0` (`discountedGBM_eq_itoIntegral`) makes the drift
  vanish — the Itô-integral content of the discounted-GBM martingale (no new analytic machinery
  beyond the `phi'_eq_one_of_lt` plateau-slope lemma). corpus 295 → **297**, 260 → **262 full**.

- **The Itô formula reaches a general (constant-coefficient) Itô process**
  (`Foundations/ItoFormulaItoProcess.lean`, entry `sc-ito-formula-ito-process`, `full`). The
  natural successor to GBM: `ito_formula_itoProcess` decomposes `f(X)` for an *arbitrary* `C³`
  exponential-growth `f` against `X_t = X₀ + b·t + σ B_t`, giving
  `f(X_T) − f(X₀) =ᵐ itoIntegralCLM_T gfx + ∫₀ᵀ (f'(X)·b + ½f''(X)·σ²) ds` — i.e.
  `∫ f'(X) dX + ½∫ f''(X)σ² ds`, the diffusion the genuine continuous Itô integral. It generalizes
  `ito_formula_gbm` (the `f = S₀·exp` case) by the *same* time-localization of the inner exponent
  `b·t`; constant coefficients keep the diffusion integrand `σ f'(X_s)` a function of `B_s`. The
  shared `SmoothTrunc` plateau lemmas (`cut_eq_id_of_abs_le`, `cutD1_eq_one_of_abs_lt`,
  `phi'_eq_one_of_lt`) were lifted into `ItoFormulaLocalized.lean` so both formulas consume them
  (the values-panel coherence follow-up, now done). corpus 297 → **298**, 262 → **263 full**.

- **Itô's lemma as a process — the semimartingale decomposition**
  (`Foundations/ItoFormulaProcess.lean`, entry `sc-ito-formula-td-process`, `full`). Lifts the
  terminal time-dependent formula (a single fixed-`T` `Lp` statement) to a **process identity**
  holding for *every* `t ≤ T` simultaneously:
  `f(t,B_t) − f(0,B_0) =ᵐ (itoProcessL2Inf t F) + ∫₀ᵗ (f_t + ½f_xx) ds`, the stochastic term the
  genuine Itô-integral **process** `(f_x(·,B) ● B)_t` — a continuous `L²` martingale with an
  everywhere-continuous **local-martingale** modification on the null-augmented filtration, so the
  compensated process `f(t,B_t)−f(0,B_0)−∫₀ᵗ drift` is (a modification of) a continuous local
  martingale. This makes the `[0,∞)` continuous-local-martingale arc (corpus 289→292)
  **load-bearing as an Itô-formula consumer** for the first time, and is the chosen prerequisite for
  the unrestricted-`C²` (stopping-time localization) Itô formula — **Summit C**, now scoped next.
  The build is entirely inside the Itô tower (**no Markov property, no PDE**): the terminal formula's
  witness is now canonical (`ito_formula_td_L2_bddDeriv_explicit` exposes `gfx =ᵐ [f_x(·,B)]`),
  zero-extended to a `[0,∞)` integrand (`exists_fullHorizon_extension`) and matched to each horizon
  by the existing consistency `itoProcessL2Inf_eq_itoProcessCLM`. corpus 298 → **299**,
  263 → **264 full**.

- **The Brownian exit times as a localizing sequence — the localization engine**
  (`Foundations/ExitTime.lean`, entry `sc-exit-times-localizing-sequence`, `full`). The exit times
  `τ_N = inf {t : N ≤ |B_t|}` of the **closed** exterior `{x : N ≤ |x|}` form the repo's **first
  genuine `IsLocalizingSequence`** (`isLocalizingSequence_exitTime`) for the null-augmented Brownian
  filtration: each `τ_N` is a stopping time for the **raw** filtration (`isStoppingTime_exitTime`),
  the sequence is a.s. monotone (`exitTime_monotone`), and it escapes to `⊤` a.s.
  (`exitTime_tendsto_top`). The **closed** exterior is the decisive design choice — it makes
  `{τ_N ≤ i}` the *attained*-`sInf` event (continuity of paths + `IsClosed.csInf_mem`), hence the
  rational `⋂ₘ ⋃_{q≤i} {N−1/(m+1) ≤ |B_q|}` event, measurable in `𝓕_i` with **no right-continuity**.
  (The open-exterior `{N < |x|}` route only characterizes `{τ_N < i}`, which lands in the
  right-continuous `𝓕_{i⁺}` the natural Brownian filtration does not provide — Blumenthal.) This is
  **Stage 1 of Summit C**: the localization machinery that lifts the bounded-derivative Itô formula
  toward unbounded coefficients. corpus 299 → **300**, 264 → **265 full**.

- **The unrestricted-`C³` Itô formula via stopping-time localization — Summit C**
  (`Foundations/ItoFormulaUnrestricted.lean`, entry `sc-ito-formula-unrestricted-local`, `full`).
  For a general `C³` `f` (six partials, all jointly continuous, **no** growth/boundedness), the
  residual `M_t = f(t,B_t) − f(0,B_0) − ∫₀ᵗ(f_t+½f_xx)ds` is everywhere-continuous, satisfies the
  Itô identity by construction, and is a continuous local martingale in **explicit form**
  (`ito_formula_unrestricted_local`): a localizing sequence `σ_N = min(τ_N, N) ↑ ⊤`
  (`isLocalizingSequence_sigma`, the exit times capped in time) plus per-`N` continuous **true**
  martingales `Mₙ` (`exists_continuous_martingale_modification_infinite` of the truncated integrand)
  agreeing with `M` on `{t ≤ σ_N}`. Stage 2 is the **double cutoff** `fTrunc N = f(φₙ·, φₙ·)`
  (time *and* space — a general `C³` `f` has `t`-derivatives unbounded over `t ∈ ℝ`, so the time cut
  is essential), whose globally-bounded derivatives feed `ito_formula_td_process`; Stage 3 the
  exit-time confinement (`abs_le_N_of_le_exitTime`) + cut-inactivity collapsing `fTrunc → f`; the
  all-time agreement crux `indistinguishable_on_stochInterval` (dense-rational agreement +
  `Set.EqOn.closure` + boundary left-continuity) is proved and axioms-clean. corpus 300 → **301**,
  265 → **266 full**.

- **Summit C in Degenne's `IsLocalMartingale` typeclass — the wrapper completed**
  (`Foundations/ItoFormulaUnrestrictedLocMart.lean`, entry
  `sc-ito-formula-unrestricted-islocalmartingale`, `full`). The unrestricted-`C³` residual `M` is now
  a genuine **`IsLocalMartingale`** (`ito_formula_unrestricted`). The one ingredient beyond the
  explicit form — adaptedness of `M` (`residual_stronglyMeasurable`), reducing to the drift primitive
  `D_t = ∫₀ᵗ drift` being `𝓕_t`-measurable (`driftPrimitive_stronglyMeasurable`: time-clamp the
  integrand so every slice is `𝓕_t`-measurable, then Carathéodory
  `stronglyMeasurable_uncurry_of_continuous_of_stronglyMeasurable` + `StronglyMeasurable.integral_prod_right`,
  worked under a `letI` sub-σ-algebra) — is discharged; then `StronglyAdapted.stoppedProcess_indicator`
  + the all-time agreement `indistinguishable_on_stochInterval` assemble `Locally (Martingale ∧ cadlag)`
  with the exit-time localizer `σ_N`. corpus 301 → **302**, 266 → **267 full**. *Summit C is now
  complete in both the explicit and the typeclass forms.*

**Open frontier:** the Itô formula against a general Itô
process with **adapted** coefficients
(the random-integrand semimartingale form — a new tower layer beyond the constant-coefficient case
just landed); re-ground `discountedGBM_isMartingale` at the *process* level (all `t`, on the
Brownian filtration) on the Itô integral, completing the GBM/BS pricing-tower migration the
terminal-time `discountedGBM_eq_itoIntegral` opens; unrestricted C² Itô formula via localization
(Summit C); the Itô formula *against a general Itô process* `∫ f'(X) dX` (drift+diffusion `X`
beyond the GBM closed form); general-Ω multi-period DMW FTAP; SDE existence and uniqueness
(Itô–Picard iteration); Lévy's martingale characterization of Brownian motion.

## phase: continuous first-FTAP frame — meaning 1 (2026-07-12, corpus 326→330)

The model-agnostic continuous-market EMM frame + the discounted-GBM instance. Four `full` entries
(`gir-continuous-emm-forward`, `gir-discounted-gbm-emm`, `gir-discounted-gbm-no-arbitrage`,
`gir-martingale-reindex`). `isEMM_noArbitrageSimple`: an equivalent martingale measure precludes
arbitrage against SIMPLE (piecewise-constant, predictable, bounded) strategies — a direct term-by-term
proof via the bilinear `condExp` pull-out, sharing the vanishing primitive
`ae_zero_of_nonneg_of_integral_zero` with the discrete FTAP. Instance at `F = ℝ` via
`discountedGBM_isEMM` (`Q = P`).

**Honest scope:** meaning-1. The physical-measure Girsanov EMM `Q ≠ P` is intrinsically bounded-horizon
(`Q = withDensity Z_T` is a martingale measure only on `[0,T]`) → a horizon-aware EMM is the meaning-1.5
backlog. General admissible strategies / NFLVR / the converse (Delbaen–Schachermayer) are meaning-2.
`IsEMM`-on-a-process is DS-shaped, so meaning 2 is additive.

**Next:** (1) horizon-aware EMM for the Girsanov `Q ≠ P` instance; (2) the discrete general-Ω
multi-period DMW crown (the nearer FTAP summit); (3) meaning-2 Delbaen–Schachermayer proper.

## phase: jump/Lévy axis opened — the Itô–Lévy isometry, simple integrands (2026-07-17, corpus 335→336)

The first rung of stochastic integration against a compensated Poisson random measure. One `full`
entry `sc-levy-isometry-compensated-simple`: the Itô–Lévy `L²` isometry for a simple predictable
integrand over a time×mark grid,
`𝔼[(∑ⱼ∑ₗ φⱼₗ·Ñ((tⱼ,tⱼ₊₁]×Aₗ))²] = ∑ⱼ∑ₗ 𝔼[φⱼₗ²]·(tⱼ₊₁−tⱼ)·ν(Aₗ)`. Three new Foundations modules:
`PoissonRandomMeasure` (the PRM as a hypothesis-bundling structure + the Poisson moments `𝔼[N]=r`,
`𝔼[N²]=r²+r` gap-filled by a pmf index-shift `(n+1)·c_r(n+1)=r·c_r(n)`, since Mathlib carries the
Poisson law but not its variance), `PoissonCompensatedIsometryAdapted` (the energy kernel), and
`PoissonCompensatedIntegralL2` (the grid double-sum). The design mirrors our continuous
`ito_isometry_discrete` 1:1 but is hand-rolled: Mathlib/Degenne have no marked simple-process object,
so the `time×mark` double sum is built from scratch.

**The honesty differentiator.** We *prove* what `cgarryZA/LevyStochCalc` (Apache-2.0, cited) states as
its axiom #6. The PRM independence is one faithful structure field `indep_of_disjoint_region`
(independent scattering: `N` on any region disjoint from `D` is independent of `N(·,D)`), which
subsumes disjoint-box and past/future independence and closes *every* cross-term uniformly —
including the same-time / different-mark pairs a marked integrand produces, which neither a pure
disjoint-count nor a pure past/future field would.

**Honest scope:** the isometry is proved for SIMPLE integrands (LevyStochCalc's axiom is over general
`L²` integrands). Deferred, declared: (1) B2 — the dense `L²` extension to a continuous-integral CLM
(mirroring `ItoIntegralL2Dense`, with the extra mark-dimension π-system), i.e. axiom #6 in full; (2)
PRM *existence* (their axiom #2) — Mathlib has no PRM substrate, a separate Summit.

**Update (2026-07-17, B2 norm-form isometry):** `sc-levy-isometry-normform`
(`Foundations/PoissonCompensatedIntegralL2Dense`) recasts the simple isometry into norm-preserving
form `𝔼[(∫ H dÑ)²] = ‖H‖²_{L²(dP⊗dt⊗dν)}` — the integrand's own `L²(P⊗ν̂)`-norm equals the integral's
`L²(P)`-norm (the usual statement, and the identity `LinearMap.extendOfNorm` completes the CLM from).
The integrand-norm computation `∫ H² d(P⊗ν̂) = ∑ⱼ∑ₗ 𝔼[φⱼₗ²]·(tⱼ₊₁−tⱼ)·ν(Aₗ)` mirrors our continuous
`simpleProcessL2_norm_sq` but is *simpler* (disjoint grid boxes ⇒ cross terms vanish by `ν̂(∩)=0`, no
interval-overlap formula). What remains for the full CLM: the integral **operator** over the
*characterised* predictable `L²` needs (a) the overlapping-box bilinear kernel (general integrands,
mirroring `rect_increment_pairing`) and (b) a from-scratch marked-predictable `σ`-algebra + density
for the PRM filtration — a genuine Summit, since Degenne's Brownian `ItoIntegralCLM` machinery is not
reusable for the PRM's own filtration.

**Next:** (1) the CLM operator (overlapping-box kernel + marked-predictable density); (2) the
Itô–Lévy *formula* and a jump-FTAP once the operator exists; (3) upstream the Poisson variance to
Mathlib.

## phase: the Itô–Lévy integral CLM — axiom #6 in full generality (2026-07-18, corpus 336→339)

The compensated-Poisson stochastic integral is now a **continuous linear operator on its full `L²`
closure**, an isometry — `cgarryZA/LevyStochCalc`'s cited **axiom #6 in full generality**, closing the
dense-extension Summit the simple-integrand rungs declared. Three new `full` entries land the two
rungs the prior *Next* called for.

**Rung 2 — the overlapping-box bilinear kernel** (`sc-levy-bilinear-pairing`,
`Foundations/PoissonCompensatedBilinear`): `𝔼[(φa·Ñ(boxa))(φb·Ñ(boxb))] = 𝔼[φa·φb]·ν̂(boxa∩boxb)` for
past-adapted bounded weights over general overlapping space-time boxes — the jump analogue of the
Brownian `rect_increment_pairing`, the inner-product core an isometry sums over. Built on a master
weighted-future pairing that generalizes the `φ≡1` covariance (`Ñ` is an orthogonal martingale
measure). **Design win**: the whole pairing rests on the *single* `indep_of_disjoint_region` field —
no past⟂future `σ`-algebra — and that same independence *buys* the triple-product integrability, so
bounded / `L²` weights suffice.

**Rung 3 — the operator and its isometry** (`sc-levy-integral-clm-isometry`,
`Foundations/PoissonCompensatedSimpleIntegrand` + `PoissonCompensatedIntegralOperator`). The source is
`levySimpleModule`, the marked simple integrands `∑_b φ_b·𝟙_{(s,t]×A}` encoded as a `Finsupp`
**submodule** — adaptedness / finite-mark / boundedness are `+`/`•`/`0`-closed, so no bespoke `Module`
boilerplate (Degenne hand-built the Brownian `SimpleProcess` instances). Two `L²` embeddings
`intAssembly` (into `L²(P)`) and `emb` (into `L²(dP⊗dν̂)`) have equal norm (`assembly_isometry`) —
both squared norms expand into the *same* box-family double sum, equated term-by-term by the rung-2
pairing (compensated side) and Fubini (integrand side). Then `itoLevyIntegralL2 : levyClosure N →L[ℝ]
L²(P)` via `LinearMap.extendOfNorm`, and `‖itoLevyIntegralL2 H‖ = ‖H‖` on the whole closure.

**The Summit dissolved, not climbed.** The prior *Next* flagged a *from-scratch marked-predictable
`σ`-algebra + density* as "a genuine Summit". We sidestepped it: define the operator's domain **as**
`topologicalClosure(range emb)`, so density is a soft `Topology.IsInducing.subtypeVal.dense_iff` fact
(the range's ambient closure *is* the target by construction). The continuous Itô CLM paid for a
bespoke trimmed measure to get a *characterised* predictable `L²`; the isometry-extension needs only
the closure, and gets it for free.

**Two engineering notes worth the record.** (a) `extendOfNorm` into a submodule codomain hits a
`Submodule.addCommMonoid` vs seminormed-group `AddCommMonoid` instance diamond; bridge the `def` with
`refine LinearMap.extendOfNorm (E:=)(F:=) f ?_; exact e` (the CLM goal type pre-pins the normed
instances so `exact` is one cheap `isDefEq`) and the norm theorem with `unfold` + a raised
`maxHeartbeats` (see `docs/patterns.md`). (b) The generic isometry kernel
`norm_extendOfNorm_eq_of_isometry` was lifted out of `WienerIntegral.lean` into a `Mathlib`-only leaf
`Foundations/ExtendOfNormIsometry.lean` (now shared by the Wiener, Itô, and Lévy towers) — a clean
single home whose one-time cost was restaling the whole Itô-chain ledger (its transitive importers).

**Next:** PRM *existence* (LevyStochCalc's axiom #2 — Mathlib has no PRM substrate) is the remaining
Summit; then the Itô–Lévy *formula* and a jump-FTAP become reachable; upstream the Poisson variance to
Mathlib.

## program: HJM interest-rate models — ratified, keystone = a cross-tower stochastic Fubini (2026-07-18)

The next depth axis is the **Heath–Jarrow–Morton drift condition**: the discounted zero-coupon bond
`P(·,T)/B(·)` is a `Q`-martingale for every maturity iff `α(t,T) = σ(t,T) ∫_t^T σ(t,u) du` — the forward-rate
drift pinned entirely by its own volatility. Ambition is the **full landmark**: the bond dynamics are
*derived*, nothing assumed. Design ratified in `docs/hjm-program.md`; tracked in #138 (children #139–#158).

**The axis is not HJM, it is a shared primitive.** The interchange the whole result rests on —
`∫_t^T (∫₀ᵗ σ(s,u) dW_s) du = ∫₀ᵗ (∫_t^T σ(s,u) du) dW_s` — is "an integral-CLM commutes with a Bochner
parameter-integral", i.e. Mathlib's `ContinuousLinearMap.integral_comp_comm` instantiated at each tower's
integral CLM (`wienerIntegralLp`, `itoIntegralCLM_T`, `itoLevyIntegralL2`). The shared `extendOfNorm`/CLM
abstraction that already unified the Wiener, Itô, and Lévy towers is exactly what makes Fubini cheap — the
same *"the Summit dissolved, not climbed"* move as the Lévy CLM. Built once, it also unblocks the Lévy
term-structure (#132, #133) and a Vasicek integrated-rate refactor. One genuinely analytic leaf remains: the
L²-representative lemma (#141).

**Atomic path (19 open issues, 6 tiers):** stochastic Fubini (#141–#145) → log-bond dynamics (#146–#148) →
bond / discounted-bond dynamics (#149–#150) → the drift condition #152 (crown) and #154 (iff) → the bridges,
Ho–Lee #156 and the Vasicek/Hull–White seam #157. Musiela (#158) is a deferred SPDE summit (placeholder).

**Next:** the keystone `stochFubini_ofCLM` (#141, the tower-agnostic primitive) then its Itô instance (#142)
— every downstream tier waits on it; its one hard step is the L²-representative fact (maybe already in Mathlib).
#140 (a would-be `integral_comp_comm` wrapper) was dissolved into #141 as an anti-wrapper cleanup.

## closed: the localized Itô formula now identifies its integrand (2026-08-07, [#183](https://github.com/formal-applied-math/formal-mathfin/issues/183))

Opened 2026-08-06 out of Task 3 of the martingale-representation program, closed the next day.
`ito_formula_td_localized` returned a bare `∃ gfx` and everything built on it inherited that shape, so
no consumer of `ito_formula_gbm` or `discountedGBM_eq_itoIntegral` could identify the diffusion
coefficient — the library could not say "the delta is `σŜ`".

Every link now carries `gfx =ᵐ [the integrand]`:
`ito_formula_td_L2_bddDeriv → cutoff_bddDeriv → ito_formula_td_localized → ito_formula_itoProcess →
ito_formula_gbm`/`ito_formula_expBrownian → discountedGBM_eq_itoIntegral`, ending at
`gfx =ᵐ [σ·Ŝ(·)]` for the discounted GBM.

**The argument is cheaper than the one the issue projected.** The plan was to redo the `L²`-limit with
an a.e.-identification pass, which reads as needing `f_x(·, B_·) ∈ L²(trim)` first. It does not. Each
cutoff's chain-rule integrand `f_x(·, φₙ(B))·φₙ'(B)` is *eventually constant* at `f_x(·, B)` at every
point — once `n ≥ |B|` the truncation is inert (`φₙ = id`, `φₙ' = 1`) — and an `L²` limit agrees a.e.
with a pointwise limit of a.e. representatives, because `L²` convergence gives a.e. convergence along a
subsequence and limits in `ℝ` are unique. That is `ae_eq_of_tendsto_Lp_of_tendsto`, a general
`Lp` fact stated once and applied once. The `L²` membership of `f_x(·, B_·)` then falls out *of* the
identification instead of being a prerequisite for it.

Two things the fix surfaced that the issue did not name. First, the forgetful wrapper: the naming
conjunct had existed all along in `ito_formula_td_L2_bddDeriv_explicit`, and
`ito_formula_td_L2_bddDeriv` was a wrapper whose only job was to drop it — the exact mechanism that
produced the gap. The two are now one theorem under the shorter name. Second, the corpus prose was
already ahead of the corpus statements: all five affected entries described the integral as
`∫₀ᵀ f_x(s,B_s) dB_s` or `∫₀ᵀ σŜ(s) dB_s` in their descriptions and docstrings while stating only
`∃ gfx`. The statements have caught up with what was being claimed for them.

## audit: prose against statement, repo-wide (2026-08-07, corpus 351 unchanged)

Follow-on to [#183](https://github.com/formal-applied-math/formal-mathfin/issues/183), which surfaced the
defect twice in one day and so stopped being a one-off. Six places claimed more than the Lean proved.
The class is structural, not careless: prose is written to describe the theorem the author has in mind,
the statement lands weaker, and nothing re-reads one against the other.

Found and fixed: `sc-thm-7.1.1`, the `C²` sibling of the #183 chain — its description wrote
`∫₀ᵗ f'(B_s) dB_s` over an `∃ gf'`, so the conjunct now runs
`itoIntegralCLM_T_of_bdd_cont → ito_formula_L2_bddDeriv → _mk`. Four descriptions that claimed a
textbook theorem the entry narrows: `cm-thm-4.3.10` (no `L^p` convergence), `sc-thm-8.2.5` (uniqueness,
not existence), `sc-thm-7.4.5` (constant `σ`), `sc-thm-9.2.1` (the Feynman–Kac identification, not
uniqueness of a bounded classical solution). And the README landmark row rendering
`ito_formula_unrestricted` as an integral identity when it proves a local-martingale statement.

Also retired: `ae_fst_mem_Ioc_trimMeasure_T` written **six** times across five files, the sixth added
the day before by the audit's own author. That is the previous review's headline failure repeating in a
new shape, which is why the top backlog item is now a duplicate-statement detector rather than another
note telling people not to duplicate.

Made permanent, per the user's instruction that this become a final step before any future development:
`test_values.py::test_prose_does_not_outrun_statement` for the mechanical slice (an `∃` whose witness is
never pinned while the prose writes the integral that would pin it), the standing first pass in
`docs/values-review.md`'s protocol, and the corresponding paragraph in `CLAUDE.md`.

**Still open, and it is the bigger half:** `description` has two incompatible jobs. For 36 entries it is
the textbook target, for the rest the delivered result, nothing marks which, and it ships in the HF
dataset. Four of the five highest-risk ones are corrected ad hoc; the other 32 are unread against their
statements.

## phase: martingale representation + market completeness (2026-08-07, corpus 348→351)

Conversion #4 of the 2026-06-29 table, the one flagged "HIGH (Clark-Hida; may need upstream)". It needed
neither Malliavin calculus nor anything upstream. `itoIntegralCLM_T` was already a `LinearIsometry` from
the predictable `L²(dt⊗dμ)` integrands into `L²(μ)`; the missing fact was the identity of its image, and
surjectivity onto a closed subspace is a **totality** statement, so the proof is an orthogonal
decomposition plus a density argument in disguise. Six new modules, ~2,430 lines. Five carry the theorem:
`BrownianCylinderGeneration` (the natural filtration as the supremum of dyadic cylinder σ-algebras, bundled
as a `Filtration ℕ`), `ItoIntegralLocality` (`𝓕_a`-linearity of the terminal integral, by
`DenseRange.equalizer` on simple-process assemblies), `DoleansStepRepresentation` (every step-integrand
Doléans exponential, minus one, lies in the range), `WienerExponentialTotality` (anything orthogonal to all
of them is zero, by Abel summation → MGF analytic continuation on cylinders → Lévy upward convergence), and
`MartingaleRepresentation` itself, where the two halves meet in the ambient `L²(μ)`.
`gir-thm-9.3.4` flips `reduced_core → full` (14 → 13 reduced cores) and three entries are new:
`gir-mrt-range-surjective`, `gir-market-completeness`, `gir-pricing-measure-unique`. Ledger 351 fresh,
pytest 42, `lake build` + `lake lint` green, five curated axiom pins holding.

`MarketCompleteness` is the finance reading: `exists_replicating_strategy` (`∃!` hedge for every
square-integrable `𝓕ᴮ_T`-claim, priced at `𝔼_μ[H]`) and `superReplication_eq_emm_price` (the
continuous-time superreplication duality at that same price). Neither closes
[#39](https://github.com/formal-applied-math/formal-mathfin/issues/39): `Foundations/SuperhedgingDuality` is a
finite-state one-period matrix model whose Farkas gate is untouched, and the two dualities hold for
structurally different reasons, separation there and martingale representation here.

**What the uniqueness half does and does not claim.** `measure_eq_of_pricesGainsAtZero` is uniqueness of
the pricing measure on the Brownian filtration *for measures that price the traded gains at zero*. It is not
the unconditional second FTAP: the textbook fair-game step needs the replicating wealth to be an integral
against the price `S`, the wealth here integrates against `B`, and `S` and `B` share only a filtration, so
that step is a named hypothesis (`PricesGainsAtZero`) guarded by two proved facts, `pricesGainsAtZero_self`
and `pricesGainsAtZero_of_gains_martingale`. Only `complete ⟹ unique` is delivered.

**Item (1) below was executed 2026-08-16 — see the phase at the end of this file.** `∫ φ dS` exists,
`PricesGainsAtZero` is a conclusion under a square-integrable density, and the hedge is held in the
price. The caveat above is retired rather than restated, though its statements remain true as written.

**Next on this axis, in order of what would actually be consumed:** (1) ~~the stochastic integral
`∫ φ dS` against a general price process~~ **done (2026-08-16)**, for a driftless Itô-process price;
the general-semimartingale integral and a drift term remain; (2) the converse `unique ⟹ complete`, needing the Jacod–Yor
extreme-point characterisation of the set of martingale measures, additive rather than a rewrite; (3)
composing the two `PricesGainsAtZero` guards, since `pricesGainsAtZero_self` is proved directly and so
never exhibits `_of_gains_martingale`'s hypothesis triple as inhabited. The real cost there is that the
repo has a bundled `Martingale` only for `itoSimpleProcess`, and a general integrand has only the pointwise
`itoIntegralProcessGen_isMartingale`. Novikov (`gir-thm-9.1.7`) and Lévy's characterization
(`sc-thm-9.1.1`) remain the two Itô-tower `reduced_core`s from the original conversion table.


## phase: the Itô chain rule, the integral against a price, and the pricing measure (2026-08-16, corpus 353→358)

The seam Leap 5 left open. Martingale representation produced a hedge, but as an integrand against
the **driver** `B`; a trader holds units of the **price**. Six places in the repo — `AxiomAudit`,
`ContinuousMarket`, `MarketCompleteness`, `bridges.md`, `leaps.md`, `mathematical-architecture.md` —
recorded the same missing primitive, `∫ φ dS`. This phase builds it and cashes it.

**The construction is a transport, not a second tower.** For a driver `φ` and `M = φ●B`, the bracket
is `d⟨M⟩ = φ² ds`, so the integrands square-integrable against `M` are `L²(φ²·trim_T)`; and
`ψ ↦ ψφ` is an isometry from there into `L²(trim_T)`. Composing with `itoIntegralCLM_T` gives
`∫· dM` with the correct domain and the correct isometry `‖∫ψ dM‖ = ‖ψ‖_{L²(⟨M⟩)}` for free. Two
alternatives were considered and rejected in the design: building from scratch (which needs the
*conditional* bracket identity the tower lacks, and whose extra generality has no consumer at this
pin), and a bare formula on the flat domain (which is not a CLM and whose isometry cannot even be
stated in the `⟨M⟩` norm).

**What earns the name.** Defining by a formula proves nothing. `itoIntegralAgainst_elementary` shows
that on a band `Z·1_{(a,b]}` the construction returns `Z·(M_b − M_a)` — the Riemann–Stieltjes sum.
Both halves already existed in the locality file: `1_{(a,b]}·φ` is a difference of two
`restrictAfterCLM`, whose integrals are `M_a` and `M_b`, and the `𝓕_a`-measurable factor passes
through by `itoIntegralCLM_T_smulAdapted`.

**The finance payoff.** `exists_replicating_strategy_in_price`: every square-integrable `𝓕ᴮ_T`-claim
is the terminal wealth of a *unique holding in `S`*. Only `σ ≠ 0` a.e. is needed — the weighted norm
rescales, `‖ψ‖_{L²(⟨S⟩)} = ‖φ‖`, so no uniform lower bound, which would have been a real restriction
on the model. Then `measure_eq_of_density`: if `S` is a `Q`-martingale and `Q = D·μ` with
`D ∈ L²(μ)`, then `Q` prices the traded gains at zero — a **conclusion**, where
`measure_eq_of_pricesGainsAtZero` had to assume it — and agrees with `μ` on all of `𝓕ᴮ_T`. The
argument uses no stochastic integration under `Q`: the functional `ψ ↦ 𝔼_Q[∫ψ dS]` is `⟪D, ·⟫`
composed with an isometry, so continuity is `innerSL`'s; it vanishes on a band because that integral
is a bounded predictable weight against a `Q`-martingale increment; then on simple processes by
linearity and the `Lp` band decomposition; then everywhere by density.

**Three things the work corrected in passing.** The design called for porting the 150-line π-λ
density induction to a second measure; unnecessary, because the core only uses *integrability*, so
the weight moves into the integrand as `h := f²·g` (which is `L¹` and generally not `L²` — hence the
core's hypothesis was weakened). De-privatising `increment_integrable` let `lake lint` see that it
never used its `IsProbabilityMeasure`, invisible while the lemma was private. And
`measure_eq_of_density` first carried `Q ≪ μ` beside the density hypothesis, which derives it — a
spurious guard, removed rather than shipped.

**What stays open, and is stated in every artifact that mentions this work:** square-integrability
of the density (it is what buys continuity, and this argument does not remove it); a **drift** in the
price (additive, reusing the pathwise drift object the Girsanov work built — and what the HJM bond
dynamics need); the Jacod–Yor converse `unique ⟹ complete`; the integral against a general
semimartingale, so `ContinuousMarket`'s meaning-2 boundary narrows without closing; and the summed
band identity over a general simple process, for which the library has the `Lp` decomposition but not
the summed statement. Degenne's axiomatic `IsStochasticIntegral` is the right frame for the
uniqueness clause and exists only on `v4.33.0-rc1`, so instantiating it waits for a stable pin.

## phase: the contracts tower — a reified payoff language, closed to Black–Scholes (2026-08-17, corpus 358→367)

MathFin had 62 payoff-bearing modules and no object that represents *a contract*: every payoff was
a lambda written inline inside the integral that priced it, so the payoff and the model were the
same syntactic object and nothing could be said about one without the other. `MathFin/Contracts/`
(`Core.lean`, `Adapted.lean`, `Pricing.lean`, `BlackScholes.lean`, `CappedCall.lean`) reifies the
payoff as data — `Payoff ι` / `Contract ι` inductives over a typed underlying index — proves the
reification is measurable and adapted to its own observation times, and closes the loop: the
reified European call, put, digital and capped call all price to Black–Scholes closed forms the
library already had, the capped call by *composing* two `value_europeanCall` results rather than
evaluating a third integral (`value_pay_eq` is the one reduction lemma every instrument shares).
Full design: `docs/specs/2026-08-16-contracts-tower-design.md`.

**Consulted as a source, not a template.** Paul Bilokon, *The Contract Is Not the Model:
Proof-Carrying Exotic Derivatives and the Economics of Model Risk* (working paper, 9 August 2026;
code at `github.com/thalesians/lean_contracts`, Apache-2.0) supplies the thesis — the deterministic
cashflow map is a separate object from the probability law over scenarios, and must be validated
first — and the five-layer decomposition it implies. No code is taken; see `docs/sources.md` for
what was and was not. The type design (typed `ι` rather than `String` keys, `ℝ≥0` time, one
inductive rather than a mutual `NumExpr`/`BoolExpr` pair), the measurability/adaptedness theorems,
and the reduction to existing closed forms have no counterpart in the source, whose own artifact
has never been kernel-built.

**Delivered, nine entries, all `full`, axioms-clean:** `mf-contract-pathpv-both`,
`mf-contract-eval-adapted`, `mf-contract-value-linear`, `mf-contract-value-deliver-asset`,
`mf-contract-european-call`, `mf-contract-european-put`, `mf-contract-digital-cash-or-nothing`,
`mf-contract-capped-call` (the payoff identity), `mf-contract-capped-call-value` (the price) — kept
as two entries rather than one so the pricing claim cannot attach itself to the entry that only
witnesses the payoff.

**Two rungs deliberately deferred, each with the concrete case that forces it, not built ahead of
that case:**

* **Branching contracts and the lifecycle state machine** (outstanding notional, absorbing
  termination, partial redemption). This is the strongest part of Bilokon's own artifact and the
  right next rung — but it earns its place only once a callable instrument is in the corpus, and
  none is yet. **Forced by:** the first autocall entry.
* **Path-dependent instances.** Every instrument in this phase observes the underlying only at its
  maturity `T`; `bsAssets` is constant in `t` and equal to the terminal log-normal price at every
  time, which is correct for these single-maturity instruments and not an oversight — it supplies
  no path. **Forced by:** wiring `bsAssets` (or a successor model map) to the full GBM path rather
  than the terminal value, which an Asian or barrier reified instrument needs.

**What stays open and is stated in every artifact this phase touches.** Rung (b) — the martingale
seam (`value_deliverAsset`, `value_process_martingale`) — is the value process, not the hedge:
`Contract.value` is not identified with the initial wealth of a replicating strategy. That
blocker's dependency, `∫ ψ dS`, landed the day before this phase as
`MarketCompletenessInPrice.exists_replicating_strategy_in_price` (previous phase, 2026-08-16), so
the hedge rung is now buildable — `ContinuousMarket.IsEMM` is still the correct target and
`pricePath` the obvious concrete `S` — but it stays out of scope here and is the strongest
candidate for the phase after the two forced rungs above. Rung (c) is single-asset (`ι = Unit`)
under `BSCallHyp`; `Payoff` is a finite inductive walked by a `List`, so every instance is a payoff
kernel over a finite observation grid — no continuously-monitored barrier is expressible at any
instantiation. None of this is a term-sheet formalisation: no calendar, business-day convention,
disruption, corporate action or issuer credit exists anywhere in the language.

Gates: `lake build MathFin` + `lake lint` green, `pytest` 50/50, ledger 367/367 fresh,
`AxiomAuditGen` 327 guards (nine new, one per corpus entry) — two of the nine also curated into
`AxiomAudit.lean` (`cappedCall_payoff_eq`, `value_cappedCall`), 231 curated guards total — no
`sorry`.

## phase: the bracket is conditional — and the route that replaced the planned one (2026-08-27, corpus 367→368)

The rung above #200. `norm_sq_increment_eq_bracket` gave `𝔼[(M_b − M_a)²] = ⟨M⟩((a,b] × Ω)`; the
conditional refinement `𝔼[(M_b − M_a)² | 𝓕_a] = 𝔼[⟨M⟩_b − ⟨M⟩_a | 𝓕_a]` was recorded in four
artifacts as unclaimed, because `bracketMeasure` weights time-and-sample by `φ²` and so integrates
`ω` out — the conditional form needs the bracket as a *pathwise* object. `PointwiseBracket.lean`
now proves it (`condExp_band_second_moment`), against `bracketRep`, the ω-wise
`∫_a^b φ_u(ω)² du` of the `Lp` class's own predictable representative.

**The design of record was dropped, and that is the phase's main content.** Part 1 (2026-08-25)
recorded a three-step route in the module docstring: polarise both quadratic sides into a bilinear
form, prove it vanishes on pairs of band generators, show the post-`a` generators span a dense
subspace, extend by ε. Roughly 800 lines, of which the pair identity's case analysis was already
200 and half-written. It was replaced because **the identity is the Itô isometry localised**: a
conditional-expectation identity between integrable variables is an identity of their `𝓕_a`-set
integrals, and on such a set `𝟙_F` is a bounded `𝓕_a`-measurable factor, so
`itoIntegralCLM_T_smulAdapted` — the `𝓕_a`-linearity the locality file built for the *first*
moment — folds it back inside a single Itô integral, that of `𝟙_F·𝟙_{(a,b]}·φ`. Squaring costs
nothing because `𝟙_F² = 𝟙_F`, so the isometry evaluates the left side, and Tonelli through the
trim evaluates the right; both meet at `∫_{(a,b]×F} φ² d trim_T`. About 200 lines, no density
argument, no polarisation and no ε — and the proof now says *why* the theorem holds rather than
grinding it out.

The generalisable form of that: **whenever an operator has a `T(Z·φ) = Z·T(φ)` lemma for bounded
`𝓕_a`-measurable `Z`, every unconditional statement about `‖T φ‖` has a conditional refinement for
free.** Recorded in `docs/patterns.md`.

**What stayed from part 1, and why.** The four conditional Brownian kernels and the band
generators are kept, not as scaffolding but as the classical facts the abstract theorem is an
abstraction of, and they reach one case it cannot: `condExp_increment_sq_of_adapted` asks only
that the coefficient be integrable against the increment, where feeding a coefficient through an
`L²(trim_T)` integrand requires it bounded. And the band generators earned their keep rather than
merely being kept: their support at both ends (`bandGen_support`, and its new mirror
`bandGen_support_after`) is precisely what `ItoIntegralLocality`'s time-locality consumes, which
pins the elementary integral as a *process* — `0` up to `c`, the explicit `Z·(B_d − B_c)` from `d`
on — and that is what lets `condExp_bandGen_second_moment` be stated on the increment `M_b − M_a`,
i.e. with literally the general theorem's left-hand side, and the classical `(d−c)·𝔼[Z²|𝓕_a]` on
the right. It is the witness that the abstract identity says the classical thing on the one
integrand whose Itô integral is written out. What was *not* formalised in that phase is the
evaluation of `bracketRep` on that integrand (`Z²·(d−c)`); the phase below closes it.

**What stays open, stated in every artifact this phase touches.** `bracketRep` is **not** claimed
adapted — predictability of the representative does not give progressive measurability at this pin
— so the bracket is delivered through its increments' conditional expectations, not as an adapted
increasing process; that is also why the right-hand side is a conditional expectation rather than
the increment itself (which is the classical statement, the increment being `𝓕_b`-measurable). No
pathwise quadratic variation is constructed: nothing in the file takes a limit of sums along
partitions, so the identification of `bracketRep` with `[M]` in the partition-limit sense remains
outside the library. What *is* proved about `bracketRep` beyond the identity: nonnegativity, band
additivity, and the monotonicity that follows.

curated axiom pin, no `sorry`.

## phase: the backlog round — the bracket is adapted, and compensates `M²` (2026-08-28, corpus 368→369)

Executed against the values-review backlog the previous phase left, in its own priority order.

**Item 1 — the adapted bracket — landed, and it was a σ-algebra problem, not an analytic one.**
The previous phase declined to claim `bracketRep` adapted, and stated why: `⇑φ` is strongly
measurable for the *predictable* σ-algebra on `ℝ≥0 × Ω`, which mixes every `𝓕_s`, so nothing about
it is `𝓕_b`-measurable on its own. What *is* true is a **trace** statement: intersected with a
band `(a,b] × Ω`, every predictable set is `Borel(ℝ≥0) ⊗ 𝓕_b`-measurable, because on a generator
`(c,d] × F` the **left** endpoint decides — either `c ≤ b`, and `F ∈ 𝓕_c ⊆ 𝓕_b`, or `c > b`, and
the intersection is empty. That asymmetry is precisely what predictability buys.

Two things made it short. The trace is itself a σ-algebra, so constructing it as one (`traceAlg`)
turns the statement into `generateFrom_le` over the predictable generators — no induction over
`MeasurableSet` anywhere. And clamping the squared representative to the band makes it
product-measurable at `b`, after which `StronglyMeasurable.integral_prod_right'` integrates the
time variable out and leaves an honestly `𝓕_b`-measurable function of `ω`
(`measurable_bracketRep`, `bracketProcess_adapted`).

**The crown that unlocks:** `condExp_sq_sub_bracket`, `𝔼[M_b² − ⟨M⟩_b | 𝓕_a] =ᵐ M_a² − ⟨M⟩_a` —
`M² − ⟨M⟩` is a martingale, which is what makes `⟨M⟩` *the* compensator of `M²` rather than a
formula with a suggestive name. Expand `(M_b − M_a)²`; the cross term collapses by pull-out and
`itoIntegralProcessGen_isMartingale`; the first term is the previous phase's conditional bracket
identity; and `⟨M⟩_b − ⟨M⟩_a` splits off the conditional expectation *only because* `⟨M⟩_a` is now
adapted. Corpus entry `sc-bracket-compensator`.

**Item 3 also landed:** `bracketRep_bandGen` evaluates the pathwise bracket of a band generator as
`Z²·(d−c)`, via the trim → product → ω-section a.e. transfer, retiring the one "true by
inspection, not formalised" caveat the previous phase shipped. **Item 5** (regenerate
`docs/blueprint.md`) is done, with two new spine nodes: `thm:conditional-bracket` and
`thm:bracket-compensator`.

**Three items were assessed and deliberately not attempted, each for a stated reason.**

* **Item 2 — pathwise quadratic variation** (identify `bracketRep` with a partition limit). This
  is the piece that would make "bracket" mean `[M]` rather than `∫φ²`, and it is a genuine
  multi-phase project: the repo has `BrownianQuadraticVariation` (Saporito 6.1.1) only in `L¹`
  form for `B` itself, and lifting it to a general `L²` integrand needs an approximation argument
  along partitions that nothing in the tower currently supplies. Attempting it inside a backlog
  round would have produced a half-finished file, which is the failure mode the previous phase
  spent its judgment avoiding.
* **Item 4 — #199, collapse `simpleAssembly_T`.** A pure refactor whose dependency runs the wrong
  way (`simpleAssemblyOfMeasure` lives *above* `simpleAssembly_T` and imports it), so it needs
  definitions moved down a module and many consumers re-routed across the Itô tower's core. High
  regression surface, no new theorem, and it should not ride along with proof work.
* **Item 6 — #194, a drift term in the Itô-process price.** An additive new construction
  (`S = S₀ + ∫b ds + (σ●B)` and `∫ψ dS := ∫ψ b ds + ∫ψ dM`) on a different seam from this one;
  it belongs to the HJM axis, not the bracket axis.

**Item 7** stays conditional by its own terms: `lpNorm_sq_eq_lintegral_enorm_sq` is to be lifted to
`LpMulIsometry` *when a second consumer appears*, and this round did not create one.

**What stays open on this seam, stated in every artifact it touches.** No pathwise quadratic
variation. No bundled `Martingale` structure for `t ↦ M_t² − ⟨M⟩_t`: `M` is `Lp`-valued and
supplies only a.e. adaptedness, the same gap `MarketCompletenessInPrice.pricePathCondExp` works
around elsewhere, and closing it here would mean rebuilding `M` from `μ[· | 𝓕_t]` as that file
does. And this is not Doob–Meyer: existence and uniqueness of a compensator for a general
submartingale is untouched.
