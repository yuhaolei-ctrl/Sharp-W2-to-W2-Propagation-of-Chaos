# The near-expiry ratio limit from the pricing contract

A deliberately crude square-root lower bound on the price suffices. At
`x=-sqrt(t)/64` it exceeds intrinsic value, forcing that point into the
continuation region. No boundary monotonicity or convexity is used.

## Result

Public entry points include `exists_boundary_sqrt_bound`, `boundary_below_linear_eventually`, `boundary_ratio_tendsto_atBot`, `zeroDividend_boundary_ratio_tendsto_atBot`.
