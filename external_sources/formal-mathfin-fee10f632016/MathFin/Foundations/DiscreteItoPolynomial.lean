/-! # Polynomial Itô remainders — item 3 of the Itô-lemma chain

The discrete Itô formula (`discrete_ito_formula`) is exact for any choice
of `f, f', f''`, with the *remainder* `discreteTaylorRemainder` absorbing
whatever isn't captured by the linear-and-quadratic Taylor expansion. For
**polynomial** `f`, that remainder is itself a polynomial in
`(X_{k+1} − X_k)` whose degree starts at *3* — exactly the order needed
for the continuous-time Itô lemma to drop the remainder in the partition
limit.

This file computes the remainder closed-form for the keystone polynomial
families:

* **`x²`** — remainder is `0` (Taylor expansion exact at degree 2;
  `discreteTaylorRemainder_sq`, already in `ItoSquaringIdentity.lean`).
* **`x³`** — remainder is `(b − a)³`.
* **`x⁴`** — remainder is `4a·(b − a)³ + (b − a)⁴`.
* **`x^(n+3)`** — remainder is `(b − a)³ · (lower-order polynomial in a, b)`,
  i.e., the third-and-higher-order Taylor tail.

The closed-form lets the continuous-time L² Itô lemma for **any polynomial**
drop the remainder via the existing third-moment bound on Brownian
increments (each `|ΔB|³` has `L¹(μ)`-norm `O(Δt^{3/2})`, summed over `n`
intervals of mesh `T/n` gives `O(T^{3/2} / √n) → 0`). The L² extension is
deferred — the polynomial *moment generation* it enables is the QF
application (recursion for `E[B_t^n]`, variance-of-variance, etc.).

## Main results

* `discreteTaylorRemainder_cube` — for `f(x) = x³`,
  `R = (b − a)³`.
* `discreteTaylorRemainder_quartic` — for `f(x) = x⁴`,
  `R = 4a·(b − a)³ + (b − a)⁴`.
* `discrete_cubing_identity` — the pathwise `X_N³ − X_0³` decomposition
  along any partition: `2·∑ X_k²·ΔX_k`, `1·∑ X_k·(ΔX_k)²` and `∑ (ΔX_k)³`.

Taylor remainder is `(b − a)³`. Pure ring identity. -/

/-- For `f(x) = x⁴`, with `f'(x) = 4x³` and `f''(x) = 12x²`, the discrete
Taylor remainder is `4·a·(b − a)³ + (b − a)⁴`. The cube term is the
deterministic part (vanishes a.s. as the partition refines, by Brownian
third-moment bounds) and the quartic term is the higher-order tail. -/

/-- **Discrete Itô identity for cubing.** For any real sequence `X` and `N`,

  `X_N³ − X_0³ = 3·∑_{k<N} X_k²·ΔX_k + 3·∑_{k<N} X_k·(ΔX_k)² + ∑_{k<N} (ΔX_k)³`.

Specialisation of `discrete_ito_formula` to `f(x) = x³`. The first sum is
the third-power discrete Itô integral; the second is the third-power QV-
weighted sum (analogous to the `½ ∑ f''(B)·(ΔB)²` term in classical Itô,
here with the explicit `f''(x) = 6x`, hence the factor `3 = 6·½`); the
third sum is the cubic remainder `∑ R_k` which goes to zero in `L¹(μ)` as
the partition refines (Brownian-cube moment bound). -/
