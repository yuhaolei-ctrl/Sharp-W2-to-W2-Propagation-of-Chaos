/-! # Continuous half-line boundary extension

The fixed-density formula includes the boundary x=0 without a singular integral.
For x>0 it agrees with integration against the heat boundary kernel in elapsed
time. This file proves continuity, the exact boundary trace, and causality for
bounded continuous data. `HeatBoundaryEquation` proves interior smoothness and
the PDE for compact continuous data. `IntervalHeatBoundary` constructs the
finite-interval heat correction; assembly in pricing coordinates is separate.

## Result

Public entry points include `heatBoundaryExtension`, `heatBoundaryExtension_integrable`, `heatBoundaryExtension_continuous`, `heatBoundaryExtension_boundary`.
