# Static Girsanov: the risk-neutral measure as a Gaussian change of measure

`BSCallHyp` — the lognormal risk-neutral hypothesis that 14 pricing files
take on faith — posits "the driver `Z` is standard normal under `Q`." This
file **derives** that hypothesis: it constructs the risk-neutral measure `Q`
from the physical measure `P` via an explicit Radon-Nikodym (Esscher)
density, and proves the recentred driver is standard normal under `Q`. The
EMM stops being an axiom.

The deductive chain:

1. `gaussian_esscher_pdf` — completing the square: `exp(c·x − c²/2)·φ₀,₁(x)
   = φ_c,₁(x)`.
2. `gaussianReal_withDensity_esscher` — measure level: tilting `N(0,1)` by
   the Esscher density gives `N(c,1)` (mean-shift by `c`, variance fixed).
3. `map_withDensity_comp` — pushforward commutes with a density factoring
   through the map (so the change of measure can be read at the level of the
   driver's law).
4. `hasLaw_esscher_tilt` — static Girsanov for a random variable: if `W` is
   standard normal under `P`, then under `Q := P.withDensity(exp(c·W−c²/2))`
   the same `W` has law `N(c,1)`.
5. `hasLaw_sub_const` — recentring: `W − c ~ N(0,1)` under `Q`.
6. `BSCallHyp.of_physical` — the capstone: `BSCallHyp` holds for `Q` and the
   recentred driver, with `Q` and the driver both *constructed* from the
   physical data. The economic instantiation is `c = (r − μ)·√T / σ`, i.e.
   the market price of risk `θ = (μ − r)/σ` enters as `c = −θ√T`; then the
   recentred driver `W − c = W + θ√T` is exactly the risk-neutral driver,
   and `bsTerminal` driven by it reprices the *same* asset with drift `μ → r`
   (see `bsTerminal_physical_eq_riskNeutral`).

This is the static (single-Gaussian) Girsanov theorem — the slice tractable
without the path-wise stochastic integral. The path-wise version is gated on
Mathlib's Itô integral (WIP in Degenne's BrownianMotion package).

/-- **The risk-neutral measure, derived** (static Girsanov capstone). Given a
standard-normal physical driver `W` under `P`, there **exists** a probability
measure `Q` — explicitly the Esscher tilt `Q = P.withDensity(exp(c·W − c²/2))`
— under which the recentred driver `W − c` satisfies the risk-neutral
hypothesis `BSCallHyp`. The risk-neutral hypothesis is thus a *theorem*: every
BS-family price, Greek, and bound that consumes `BSCallHyp` is founded on a
constructed EMM rather than an assumed one.

Economic instantiation: take `c = (r − μ)·√T / σ = −θ·√T` where `θ = (μ−r)/σ`
is the market price of risk; then `W − c = W + θ√T` is the risk-neutral
driver, and `Q` is the equivalent martingale measure — its martingale
property `E_Q[e^{−rT} S_T] = S_0` follows from the resulting `BSCallHyp` via
`discounted_terminal_eq_S0`. -/

/-- **The change of measure reprices the same asset** — the conceptual heart
of risk-neutral valuation. The Girsanov shift `c = (r − μ)·√T / σ` is exactly
the recentring under which the physical terminal `S_0·exp((μ−σ²/2)T + σ√T·W)`
equals the risk-neutral terminal `S_0·exp((r−σ²/2)T + σ√T·(W − c))`. The asset
`S_T` is invariant; only its *drift* changes `μ → r`. This is *why* the
Esscher tilt of `BSCallHyp.exists_of_physical` is the right change of
measure: it is the one that turns the real-world drift into the risk-free
rate while leaving the random variable `S_T` untouched. -/

/-! ## Wiring Girsanov into the pricing artifacts

The two composites below make `GaussianGirsanov` load-bearing: they drive the
prior pricing results from the *physical* measure through the constructed
EMM, rather than from an assumed `BSCallHyp`. This is the genesis-cascade
spine `physical measure → Girsanov → Q → pricing`. -/

/-- **The constructed measure is an equivalent martingale measure** (derived
from the physical measure). For the Esscher-tilted `Q` of
`BSCallHyp.exists_of_physical`, the discounted terminal asset is a
`Q`-martingale: `E_Q[e^{−rT}·S_T] = S_0`. This is the *defining* property of
an EMM — so the construction yields a genuine risk-neutral measure, not
merely one under which the driver is standard normal. Composes
`exists_of_physical` with `discounted_terminal_eq_S0`. -/

Instantiating the Girsanov shift at the market-price-of-risk value
`c = (r − μ)·√T/σ`, `bsTerminal_physical_eq_riskNeutral` identifies the physical
terminal `bsTerminal S_0 μ σ T W` (drift `μ`) with the risk-neutral one, and
`discounted_terminal_eq_S0_of_physical` supplies the martingale property — so
`E_Q[e^{−rT}·S_T] = S_0` holds for the asset carrying the *physical* drift `μ`.
This composes the previously-standalone drift-invariance identity into the EMM
pipeline, closing the `physical → EMM` step at the level of the physical model. -/
