# Cone-separation roots for the convex-duality unification

The shared geometric kernel of mathematical finance's convex-duality pillar: finite-dimensional
separation of a closed convex **cone** `C ⊆ (ι → ℝ)` produces a positive pricing/representing
functional. Two faces of the same Hahn–Banach principle live here:

* `exists_pos_separating_of_cone_disjoint_simplex` — a cone disjoint from the whole standard simplex
  admits a **strictly** positive functional `q` (`> 0` at every coordinate) that is `≤ 0` on the cone.
  This is the FTAP separating functional: the attainable-gains cone misses the simplex (no arbitrage)
  ⟹ the equivalent martingale measure. It generalizes the subspace kernel
  `exists_pos_dual_of_disjoint_stdSimplex` (two-sided `= 0`) to a cone (one-sided `≤ 0`).
* `exists_separating_of_not_mem_cone` — a single point outside a closed convex cone is separated by a
  functional `p` that is `≤ 0` on the cone and `> 0` at the point. This is the coherent-risk
  representing density: a rejected position separated from the acceptance cone.

Both rest on two shared atoms — `functional_eq_sum_single` (basis expansion of a functional) and
`functional_nonneg_on_cone` (a functional bounded below on a cone is `≥ 0` on it; the cone's
nonnegative-scaling homogeneity is what turns a separation bound into a sign). The separations
themselves are Mathlib's `geometric_hahn_banach_compact_closed` and `geometric_hahn_banach_point_closed`.

## API at this pin
The cone is a `C : Set (ι → ℝ)` carrying `Convex ℝ C`, `IsClosed C`, and homogeneity
`∀ x ∈ C, ∀ c ≥ 0, c • x ∈ C`. There is no `ConvexCone.dual` constant at this pin, but
`ProperCone`/`PointedCone` *are* live, and Mathlib's `ProperCone.hyperplane_separation`
(`Analysis/Convex/Cone/Dual.lean`) is the separation theorem the results below re-derive
from `geometric_hahn_banach_compact_closed`. Consuming it — packaging `C` as a
`ProperCone ℝ (ι → ℝ)` and keeping only the `Pi.single` coordinate glue — is an open
upgrade; the explicit `Set` representation is a historical choice, not a forced one.

/-- **Cone point-separation.** A point `x₀` outside a closed convex cone `C ⊆ (ι → ℝ)` is
separated by a functional `p` that is `≤ 0` on `C` and `> 0` at `x₀`. The companion to
`exists_pos_separating_of_cone_disjoint_simplex`: that separates a cone from the whole simplex
(strictly positive `q`); this separates a single exterior point from the cone (a representing
density direction). The coherent-risk representation applies it to a rejected position and the
acceptance cone. -/
