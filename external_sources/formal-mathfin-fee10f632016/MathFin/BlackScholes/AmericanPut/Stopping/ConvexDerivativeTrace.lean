public import Mathlib.Analysis.Convex.Deriv

/-! # Right derivative trace of a convex function

The derivative is squeezed between a boundary secant and a secant whose
endpoints both approach the boundary. No second derivative is required.

## Result

Public entry points include `convex_deriv_tendsto_right`.
