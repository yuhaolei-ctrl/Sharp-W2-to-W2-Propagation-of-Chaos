# Issue label taxonomy

This taxonomy gives maintainers and contributors a shared vocabulary for
triaging work. Labels should answer four questions:

- **What part of the project is affected?** Use one `area:*` label.
- **What kind of work is it?** Use one `type:*` label.
- **How hard is it for a contributor?** Use one `difficulty:*` label.
- **What is the current state?** Use one `status:*` label.

Use `good first issue` and `help wanted` as public entry-point labels on top of
the taxonomy when the task is ready for outside contributors.

Colors are consistent per dimension so an issue's labels read at a glance:
`area:*` share one hue, `type:*` another, while `difficulty:*` and `status:*`
use a semantic scale (green → amber → red).

## Area labels

The mathematical areas mirror the `MathFin/` subdirectories, so a contributor
can filter to the part of the library they know; the last three are
cross-cutting.

| Label | Use for |
|---|---|
| `area:foundations` | `MathFin/Foundations/` — Itô calculus, Brownian motion, stochastic integration, martingales, Poisson, Markov, and SDEs. |
| `area:black-scholes` | `MathFin/BlackScholes/` — the Black-Scholes model, greeks, and the pricing PDE. |
| `area:futures` | `MathFin/Futures/` — Black-76 futures options, caplets, and swaptions. |
| `area:binomial` | `MathFin/Binomial/` — CRR binomial trees and convergence to Black-Scholes. |
| `area:fixed-income` | `MathFin/FixedIncome/` — bonds, term structure, and interest-rate models. |
| `area:portfolio` | `MathFin/Portfolio/` — portfolio choice, Kelly, and Merton problems. |
| `area:performance` | `MathFin/Performance/` — Sharpe ratio and other performance measures. |
| `area:risk` | `MathFin/RiskMeasures/` — VaR, CVaR, and coherent risk measures. |
| `area:actuarial` | `MathFin/Actuarial/` — actuarial and insurance pricing. |
| `area:defi` | `MathFin/DeFi/` — decentralized-finance models. |
| `area:tooling` | Python verification tools, scripts, ledger logic, and generated audits under `tools/` and `scripts/`. |
| `area:docs` | Markdown docs, README content, onboarding, coverage/blueprint prose, and cross-links. |
| `area:ci` | GitHub Actions, Docker images, build gates, and release automation. |

## Type labels

| Label | Use for |
|---|---|
| `type:bug` | Something expected to work is broken. |
| `type:proof` | A new Lean theorem, proof repair, or theorem generalization. |
| `type:docs` | Documentation-only work. |
| `type:refactor` | Structure or naming changes that should preserve behavior and theorem statements. |
| `type:tooling` | Changes to verification scripts, exports, or developer tooling. |
| `type:research` | Open investigation where the implementation path is not yet clear. |
| `type:maintenance` | Routine cleanup, dependency updates, or housekeeping. |

## Difficulty labels

| Label | Use for |
|---|---|
| `difficulty:good-first` | Small, well-scoped task with enough context in the issue body. Add `good first issue` too. |
| `difficulty:small` | Straightforward change for someone familiar with the repo. |
| `difficulty:medium` | Requires repo context, Lean fluency, or careful validation. |
| `difficulty:hard` | Requires deep domain knowledge, theorem design, or upstream coordination. |

## Status labels

| Label | Use for | Written by |
|---|---|---|
| `status:needs-triage` | New issue that has not been classified yet. | human |
| `status:needs-info` | Waiting on clarification before work should start. | human |
| `status:ready` | Scoped enough for a contributor to pick up. | human, or the pipeline on release |
| `status:in-progress` | Someone is actively working on it. | human, or the pipeline on seed |
| `status:blocked-upstream` | Blocked on Mathlib, BrownianMotion, or another external project. | human |
| `status:blocked-design` | Blocked on a modeling, theorem-shape, or architecture decision. | human |
| `status:review` | PR exists and maintainer review is the next step. | human, or the pipeline on PR |

### Three of these are machine-written

The autoformalization pipeline in `formal-foundry` used to only READ this backlog.
It kept its own private record of which issues it had already worked, that record
drifted from reality, and the pipeline re-drafted work it had already queued. The
fix was to stop keeping a private record: **the issue is now the state machine, and
everything the pipeline stores locally is a cache of it.**

So the pipeline moves an issue between three of the seven statuses:

| transition | when |
|---|---|
| `status:ready` → `status:in-progress` | a gated Lean stub for the issue is staged in the pipeline's queue |
| `status:in-progress` → `status:review` | a PR closing the issue has been opened |
| back to `status:ready` | the PR was closed unmerged, or the staged stub was retired |
| → closed | GitHub closes it when the PR merges |

Three consequences worth knowing when you triage:

- **A label may move without a human touching it.** If an issue you filed is
  suddenly `status:in-progress` with nobody assigned, a machine drafted a statement
  for it. Nothing has been merged — see below.
- **The four other statuses are yours alone, and the pipeline will not overrule
  them.** `status:blocked-design` in particular looks identical to "ready" from the
  machine's side (no PR, no stub), so it is explicitly excluded: parking an issue
  there reliably keeps it out of the pipeline. An issue with *no* status label is
  likewise never promoted — the pipeline repairs its own writes, it does not decide
  what is worth proving.
- **`status:review` still means a human reviews it.** Scout-not-author is unchanged:
  a machine may draft a statement and find a proof, and a person refines and merges
  it. No label transition here is an approval of anything.

Label writes are best-effort by design — a failed write must never fail a pipeline
run — so a stale status is possible. The pipeline re-derives all three from the
observable facts (open PRs, staged stubs) at the start of each run, so a stale one
corrects itself rather than needing a manual fix.

## Triage examples

| Issue | Suggested labels |
|---|---|
| Add a glossary entry for no-arbitrage terms | `area:docs`, `type:docs`, `difficulty:good-first`, `status:ready`, `good first issue` |
| Repair a stale coverage row after a theorem rename | `area:docs`, `type:docs`, `difficulty:small`, `status:ready` |
| Prove a new Black-Scholes Greek | `area:black-scholes`, `type:proof`, `difficulty:medium`, `status:ready` |
| Generalize an Itô-formula hypothesis | `area:foundations`, `type:proof`, `difficulty:hard`, `status:ready` |
| Draft an upstream BrownianMotion issue | `area:foundations`, `type:research`, `difficulty:hard`, `status:blocked-upstream` |
| Fix a failing build workflow | `area:ci`, `type:bug`, `difficulty:medium`, `status:ready` |
