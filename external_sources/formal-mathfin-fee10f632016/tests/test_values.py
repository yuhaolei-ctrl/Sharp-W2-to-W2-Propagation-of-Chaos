"""Values gates — mechanical enforcement of the honesty contract over the
LIBRARY sources and the generated audit artifacts (complementing
``test_router.py``'s benchmark-level checks).

1. ``test_mathfin_sources_free_of_forbidden_text`` — scout/search/interactive
   tactics and trust-extending commands never land in committed ``MathFin/``
   sources: scout-not-author, offline-loop, and kernel-only trust, enforced
   textually (comments are stripped first, so prose may mention the words).
2. ``test_full_entries_are_not_definitional_rfl`` — a ``full`` entry's cited
   theorems (and the snippet's own declarations) must not be definitional
   ``rfl`` / ``unfold; rfl``: that is the ``reduced_core`` pattern in
   disguise. This is the entry-time version of the 2026-05-29 / 2026-06-03
   audit demotions (newton-raphson, pp-thm-3.3.5, mc-thm-1.1.2).
3. ``test_blueprint_spine_is_audited`` — every MathFin theorem on the curated
   blueprint spine is axiom-guarded in ``MathFin/AxiomAudit.lean``: the spine
   is curated prose + a generated dependency graph, the audit must be its
   superset (headliners are, at minimum, axiom-pinned).
4. ``test_axiom_audit_gen_is_fresh`` — ``MathFin/AxiomAuditGen.lean`` is
   byte-identical to the generator's output (generated artifacts are never
   hand-edited; regeneration is a no-op).
6. ``test_contracts_cite_source`` / ``test_contracts_corpus_entries_cite_source``
   — the ``MathFin/Contracts/`` tower's design is Bilokon's; every module
   docstring and every ``mf-contract-*`` corpus entry must carry the credit
   line, not just one or the other (the corpus ships in the HF dataset, so
   the citation must travel with the claim).

# The prose-vs-statement gate.
#
# Twice on 2026-08-07 a green build shipped prose that claimed more than the
# Lean beneath it. Five corpus entries described the stochastic term as
# `∫₀ᵀ f_x(s,B_s) dB_s` while their statements said only `∃ gfx` (#183), and
# the README's landmark table rendered `ito_formula_unrestricted` as an
# integral identity when the theorem proves only that a residual is a
# continuous local martingale. Nobody wrote a false claim on purpose: the
# prose described the theorem everyone had in mind and the statement quietly
# said less.
#
# This catches the mechanical half of that class — an existential whose
# witness the statement never pins down, while the prose writes the integral
# that would pin it down. The judgment half (a description that overstates in
# some other way) belongs to the values review, whose protocol now carries it
# as a standing step.
#
# Deliberately narrow: it fires only on `∃`-statements, and only when the
# prose writes an integral against a driver. A first draft accepted any `=ᵐ`
# after the `∃` as evidence of identification and so passed `sc-thm-7.1.1`,
# whose main identity is itself an `=ᵐ` — the check answered a different
# question than the one asked. Match the witness by NAME.
