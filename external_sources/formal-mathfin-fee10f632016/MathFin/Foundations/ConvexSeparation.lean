# Separating-functional kernel for the finite Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing

A finite-dimensional subspace `V ⊆ (ι → ℝ)` disjoint from the standard simplex
admits a strictly-positive dual functional that annihilates it. This is the
geometric heart of the finite-state FTAP: when the attainable-gains subspace of a
market misses the simplex (no arbitrage), the separating hyperplane *is* the
equivalent martingale measure (a strictly-positive pricing functional).

This kernel is **derived** from the cone-separation root
`exists_pos_separating_of_cone_disjoint_simplex` (`MathFin/Foundations/ConvexDuality.lean`):
a subspace is a two-sided cone, so the root's one-sided `≤ 0` bound plus neg-closure
yields the two-sided `= 0` annihilation. It is the subspace case of the convex-duality
unification.

The underlying separation is the cone root `MathFin.exists_pos_separating_of_cone_disjoint_simplex`
(`Foundations/ConvexDuality.lean`), specialised to the two-sided subspace case.
