"""Generate ``MathFin/AxiomAuditGen.lean`` — the exhaustive axiom audit.

The curated ``MathFin/AxiomAudit.lean`` pins the *headliner* theorems with
dated, storied sections. This generator closes the complement: every MathFin
constant consumed in PROOF POSITION by any benchmark snippet gets a
``#guard_msgs``-pinned ``#print axioms`` check, so no benchmark-cited theorem
can pick up ``sorryAx`` (a ``sorry``) or a non-standard axiom without
breaking ``lake build``. With this file, "the audited set is representative,
not exhaustive" stops being true for the benchmark-facing surface.

Scope (documented, deliberate):

* *proof position* means a ``MathFin.*`` constant at the head of a proof term
  (immediately after ``:=``). Statement-position defs are exercised by
  elaboration + the verification ledger; ``library_wrapper`` entries cite
  upstream (Mathlib / BrownianMotion) names, whose axiom hygiene is
  upstream's contract.
* expected messages default to the three standard axioms; pure-algebra
  results that need fewer are recorded in ``EXPECTED_OVERRIDES`` (built
  empirically from build output — the build is the oracle).

Usage::

    python3 -m tools.verify.axiom_audit_gen --check   # exit 1 if stale
    python3 -m tools.verify.axiom_audit_gen --write   # regenerate in place

Freshness is enforced by ``tests/test_values.py::test_axiom_audit_gen_is_fresh``
(the blueprint anti-restale pattern: generated artifacts are never hand-edited
and regeneration must be a no-op).

  GENERATED FILE — do not edit by hand.

  Exhaustive axiom audit: every MathFin constant consumed in PROOF POSITION
  by a benchmark snippet is #guard_msgs-pinned to its exact axiom set, so no
  benchmark-cited theorem can pick up `sorryAx` (a `sorry`) or a non-standard
  axiom without breaking `lake build`.

  The curated, storied audit is MathFin/AxiomAudit.lean (headliners + dated
  narrative); THIS file is its machine-written closure over the benchmark
  corpus ({len(names)} constants). Scope: proof-position MathFin names only —
  statement-position defs are exercised by elaboration + the verification
  ledger, and library_wrapper entries cite upstream names.
