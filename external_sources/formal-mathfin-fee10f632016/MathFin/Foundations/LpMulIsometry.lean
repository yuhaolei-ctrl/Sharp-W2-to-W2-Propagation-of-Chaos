Multiplying by a fixed measurable `f` carries the weighted space `L²(f²·ν)` isometrically
into `L²(ν)`:

  `∫ |f·ψ|² dν = ∫ |ψ|²·f² dν = ∫ |ψ|² d(f²·ν)`,

so `‖f·ψ‖_{L²(ν)} = ‖ψ‖_{L²(f²·ν)}`. This is the analytic content behind "the Itô integral
against `M = φ●B` is the Itô integral against `B` of `ψφ`": the bracket measure `d⟨M⟩ = φ²ds`
is the weight, and the chain rule is this isometry composed with `itoIntegralCLM_T`.

Mathlib carries only the `p = 1` case, `withDensitySMulLI`, where the density and the
multiplier coincide; at `p = 2` the multiplier is the *square root* of the density, which is
what makes the norm come out right. The general-`p` statement
`‖f·ψ‖_{L^p(ν)} = ‖ψ‖_{L^p(‖f‖ᵖ·ν)}` is the natural home for this and is an upstreaming
candidate; only `p = 2` is built here, since that is the only exponent the Itô tower uses.

## The well-definedness point

`Lp ℝ 2 (sqWeight ν f)` is a space of classes modulo `(f²·ν)`-null sets, which is **coarser**
than modulo `ν`-null sets: `{f = 0}` is `(f²·ν)`-null but in general not `ν`-null. So two
representatives of one class can disagree on a `ν`-non-null set, and the map `ψ ↦ f·ψ` is
still well defined — on `{f ≠ 0}` the representatives agree, and on `{f = 0}` both products
vanish. Each linearity proof below therefore ends in a case split on `f x = 0`, exactly as
Mathlib's `withDensitySMulLI` does. This is the step at which a naive attempt breaks.

## Result

* `sqWeight` — the weighted measure `f²·ν`.
* `lintegral_sqWeight` — the change-of-density identity for lower integrals.
* `eLpNorm_mul_eq` — the norm identity, for an arbitrary function.
* `integral_sqWeight`, `setIntegral_sqWeight` — the Bochner transfer, and its set form.
* `sqWeight_ae_ne_zero` — `f²·ν` is carried by `{f ≠ 0}`.
* `sqWeight_sqWeight` — **the weight composes**, `(f²·ν) weighted by g² = (fg)²·ν`; read as a
  bracket this is `d⟨ψ●M⟩ = ψ² d⟨M⟩`, and `coeFn_mulLI_mulLI` is its map-level form.
* `ae_of_sqWeight_of_ae_ne_zero` — a.e. statements transfer back when `f ≠ 0` a.e.
* `exists_mulLI_eq` — for `f ≠ 0` a.e. the multiplication isometry is **onto**: `ψ := u/f`.
* `memLp_mul` — `ψ ∈ L²(f²·ν)` implies `f·ψ ∈ L²(ν)`.
* `mulLM`, `mulLI` — the map as a linear map and as a `LinearIsometry`, with `coeFn_mulLM`
  the characterising a.e. identity.

This is the associativity of the chain rule. Reading `sqWeight` as a bracket, it says
`d⟨ψ●M⟩ = ψ² d⟨M⟩`: an Itô integral against an Itô integral is again one, with the brackets
composing the way the integrands do. -/

not transfer — but it does not need to: off `{f ≠ 0}` the outer multiplication kills both sides.
