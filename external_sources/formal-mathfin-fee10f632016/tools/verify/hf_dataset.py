"""Build the Hugging Face dataset files from the benchmark corpus.

Vendored (and made count-honest) from the original one-off
``build_dataset.py`` that published
https://huggingface.co/datasets/formal-applied-math/formal-mathfin-theorems —
this repo is the single source of truth; CI (`hf-publish.yml`) rebuilds and
uploads on every push that touches ``benchmarks/``. The dataset card's
counts are COMPUTED here at build time (the originally-published card had
already rotted to a 261-theorem snapshot — generated artifacts, never
hand-maintained).

Emits into ``--out DIR``:

* ``formal-mathfin-theorems.jsonl`` — one row per theorem: id, name, domain,
  formalization_status, description, formalization_scope, lean_code,
  source_file.

  ``formalization_scope`` was added 2026-08-07. It had existed on every entry
  and been withheld from the export, so the *claim* (``description``) shipped
  while the *disclosure* stayed private — which is exactly the asymmetry that
  let 15 of 36 textbook-framed descriptions drift into claiming more than their
  Lean proved. Publish both or neither.
* ``README.md`` — the dataset card, counts and toolchain pin computed.

Pure stdlib; safe on the host.

Usage::

    python3 -m tools.verify.hf_dataset --out dist/hf

# Formally Verified Mathematical Finance (Lean 4)

This dataset comprises {total} machine-checked theorems in mathematical
finance, formalized using Lean 4 atop Mathlib and Rémy Degenne's
BrownianMotion package. Each entry includes a theorem's formal statement,
its proof, subject area, and a "faithfulness tier" indicating alignment
between the mathematical and formal claims.

Sourced from the [`formal-mathfin`](https://github.com/formal-applied-math/formal-mathfin)
library, this collection serves as training and evaluation material for
autoformalization and automated theorem proving focused on quantitative
finance — a domain underrepresented in existing mathematical benchmarks.

## Data Structure

The dataset provides these fields for each theorem:

- **id**: theorem identifier
- **name**: human-readable title
- **domain**: subject classification
- **formalization_status**: faithfulness category
- **description**: the theorem **as this entry proves it**. Where an entry
  delivers less than the source theorem it is named after, the description says
  so — it describes the Lean, not the textbook target. The citation for the
  target is in the source text referenced by `id`.
- **formalization_scope**: per-entry disclosure — what was derived, from which
  primitives, by what method, and what is explicitly out of scope
- **lean_code**: compilable Lean 4 implementation
- **source_file**: benchmark origin

## Faithfulness Classifications

Results are categorized by how faithfully the formal statement captures the
mathematical claim: "full" ({full} theorems), "library_wrapper" ({wrap}),
and "reduced_core" ({reduced}). The first two categories comprise the
delivery-ready collection ({ready} of {total}).

## Dependencies

Compilation requires Lean {_toolchain()}, specific Mathlib and
BrownianMotion commits, accessible via the reproducible Docker image — see
the source repository for pins and instructions.
