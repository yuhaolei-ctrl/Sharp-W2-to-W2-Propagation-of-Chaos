/-! # Uniformly bounded smooth compact minorants of a continuous payoff

The minorants need not be nonnegative or monotone in the sequence index.
Their common absolute bound is what permits dominated convergence.

## Result

Public entry points include `exists_smooth_compact_minorant`, `exists_smooth_compact_minorant_sequence`.
