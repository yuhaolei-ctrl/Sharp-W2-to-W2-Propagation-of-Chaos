# Formalization Status

This project distinguishes two claims:

1. **Backend verification coverage:** active Lean code checks successfully.
2. **Faithful theorem formalization:** the checked statement closely matches the course theorem AND the proof is a real derivation, not a structural projection from an axiomatized conclusion.

The first claim is useful engineering evidence. The second is the academic claim. Do not collapse them.

## Status Vocabulary

- `full`: a faithful formal **derivation** of the textbook theorem from its hypotheses. The hypotheses must be encoded honestly (not the conclusion in disguise) and the proof must do real work — `ring`/`simp`/`rfl` on a structure-projection target does NOT qualify.
- `library_wrapper`: the active code directly invokes a named Lean library theorem whose statement matches the benchmark theorem. The library does the real work.
- `reduced_core`: the active code is honest but narrower than the textbook theorem. This includes:
  - Algebraic / analytic / distributional core checks (e.g., a constant-θ MGF identity behind Wald's exponential).
  - Lean specifications where the textbook conclusion is encoded as a structure field and the proof reads it off via projection. The structure pins down the textbook STATEMENT but does not derive the conclusion.
- `placeholder`: active prover code verifies but does not yet encode a meaningful formal statement of the textbook theorem.

For delivery claims, count only:

```text
full + library_wrapper
```

Report `reduced_core` and `placeholder` separately. **Spec-with-axiomatized-conclusion is `reduced_core`, not `full`.**

## Current Audit

### American put option boundary: geometric contribution (#175)

The two new entries below carry `formalization_status: full`. Their hypotheses
are only `K > 0`, `r > 0`, `σ > 0`, and `0 ≤ q ≤ r`. They concern the
actual stopping boundary on the constructed completed usual Brownian
filtration, not an assumed pricing-equation solution. Their time domain is
`Set.Ioi 0`. See [the declaration and definition map](american-put-boundary.md)
for the model, proof, and source provenance.

| Benchmark ID | Mathematical conclusion | Lean module and declaration | Faithfulness |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mf-american-put-log-boundary-convex` | `log(B(τ)/K)` is convex in positive time-to-expiry | `MathFin/BlackScholes/AmericanPut/Stopping/PhysicalBoundaryConvexity.lean`, `MathFin.BlackScholes.AmericanPut.Stopping.brownianUsualLogBoundary_convexOn` | `full` |
| `mf-american-put-stock-boundary-strict-convex` | `B(τ)` is strictly convex in positive time-to-expiry | Same module, `MathFin.BlackScholes.AmericanPut.Stopping.brownianUsualStockBoundary_strictConvexOn` | `full` |

The native default `lake build` passed, including `AxiomAuditGen.lean` and
the curated audit. Both new benchmark statements passed native verification;
the ledger reports 372 fresh, 0 stale, and 0 missing entries. These checks
support the formal statements, not independent mathematical peer review. No `C²`
boundary regularity, classical curvature, strict log-convexity, or `q > r`
result is claimed by these entries. The dated baseline below records the
prior corpus audit, not a verification of this addition.

> **Summit A — continuous-time Itô formula (2026-06-02).** Promoted `sc-thm-7.1.1`
> (Itô's Formula) `reduced_core`→`full`: the bounded-derivative continuous-time L² Itô
> formula `f(B_T)−f(B_0) = itoIntegralCLM_T gf' + ½∫₀ᵀ f″(B_s) ds` is now *derived* from
> foundational primitives, with the stochastic integral the genuine continuous Itô integral
> `itoIntegralCLM_T gf'` (the L²-limit of the Riemann–Itô sums). The proof chain (Summit A):
> `tendsto_weighted_qv` (weighted quadratic variation) + `tendsto_ito_remainder` (vanishing
> Itô–Taylor remainder) + `itoIntegralCLM_T_of_bdd_cont` (Riemann↔CLM bridge), assembled in
> `ito_formula_L2_bddDeriv`. Scope: `f ∈ C³` with bounded `f′,f″,f‴` — a faithful but
> strictly C³-bounded specialization of the C² textbook statement (the gap to unrestricted
> C² is Summit C localization, not yet formalized). All four Summit-A theorems are

> 4→5 full, 7→6 reduced.

> **Engine→pricing coherence — deliberate stop (2026-06-03).** The continuous Itô
> engine `itoIntegralCLM_T` has its flagship consumer (`itoIntegralCLM_T_brownian`:

> discounted price *with* the engine (`e^{−rt}S_t = S₀ + itoIntegralCLM_T(σ·e^{−r·}S_·)`),
> was scoped and **declined**: the GBM exponential is unbounded, so it is not a short
> argument but a second keystone (~400 lines — a parallel clamp-truncation layer plus the
> martingale-difference L² limit `∑σM_{t_k}ΔB → M_T−1`). It would yield an *alternative
> derivation route* to a theorem already held, not a new result, so it is recorded here as
> a known, bounded, **not-pursued** build. See *Geometric Brownian motion* /
> *Continuous-time first FTAP* in `blueprint.md`.

> **Path-1 upgrades (2026-06-04).** Seven reduced cores earned `full` by the
> upgrade-properly discipline (build the genuinely deeper theorem; never relabel):
> `mart-thm-2.3.6` — the conditional-expectation-form **optional sampling
> inequality** for submartingales (`Foundations/OptionalSamplingInequality.lean`),
> absent from Mathlib, derived as *optional sampling equality + monotone
> compensator* through the Doob decomposition;
> `mf-markowitz-n-psd` — PSD **derived** from genuine L² random returns via the
> self-dot variance identity, consuming Mathlib's `variance_sum'`
> (`Portfolio/CovariancePSD.lean`);
> `mf-cvar-rockafellar-uryasev` — the genuine **Rockafellar–Uryasev variational
> theorem** (`IsLeast`) for the Gaussian loss, minimality by the pointwise tail
> certificate (`RiskMeasures/RockafellarUryasev.lean`, which previously recorded
> only the additive identity and explicitly deferred this);
> `mf-newton-raphson-fixed-at-root` — genuine **local quadratic convergence**
> at the sharp Newton–Kantorovich constant `(L/(2m))·e²` (integral form of the
> Taylor remainder) + basin convergence of the Newton iterates
> (`BlackScholes/NewtonConvergence.lean`);
> `mf-kmv-survival-Phi-d2` — re-pointed at the probabilistic survival statement
> `Q(V_T > F) = Φ(DD)` through the lognormal tail;
> `mf-american-supermartingale` + `mf-american-intrinsic-bound` — the
> **path-space Snell envelope** (`Binomial/SnellEnvelope.lean`): payoff
> dominance, supermartingale property, adaptedness, and minimality over
> arbitrary path-processes, plus the identification theorem
> `snell = e^{−rk}·americanPrice` exhibiting the scalar Bellman recursion as
> the Markov instance (the conditional expectation is the explicit node
> average, which on a finite tree it *is* — same pathwise idiom as
> `Binomial/MartingaleRepresentation.lean`).
> All new load-bearing theorems are AxiomAudit-pinned.

> **Post-audit values sweep (2026-06-04, follow-up).** A second adversarial
> audit (four fresh reviewers over the Path-1 commit) confirmed the
> load-bearing layer — counts, statuses, scope notes, axiom pins, and the
> absence of all five headline theorems from Mathlib/BrownianMotion all
> re-verified independently — and surfaced finishing work, applied in full:
> `submartingale_optional_sampling` now consumes Mathlib's
> `Submartingale.monotone_predictablePart` (the local helper had re-derived it
> verbatim) and documents the BrownianMotion package's `sorry`-stubbed `⊓`-form
> sibling as an upstream-donation candidate;
> `portfolioVarN_covariance_eq_variance` consumes `variance_sum'` instead of
> re-tracing its bilinearity chain; **Newton sharpened to the textbook
> constant** — `(L/(2m))·e²` via the integral form of the Taylor remainder,
> basin relaxed to `L·δ ≤ m` (the uniform mean-value bound had silently cost a
> factor 2); two dead `have`s and an orphaned `@[simp]` lemma removed; the
> seven upgraded entries' stale `description` fields rewritten (four still
> asserted pre-upgrade "NOT the stronger result" disclaimers); and the build
> log swept clean — six `ring`-falls-back-to-`ring_nf` info sites and one
> `simpa` lint fixed at root (`congr`/`convert` depth bumps so `ring` sees a
> genuine ring goal instead of `exp A = exp B`).

> **Headline-theorem wiring (2026-06-04, same day).** The library's deepest

## History

Per-pass session logs and the pre-2026-05 hybrid-backend validation records
were removed from this file on 2026-05-30, when the SymPy and Isabelle backends
were stripped (the project is Lean-only). They remain in git history. The
2026-05-29 honesty re-audit — the basis for the current counts above — is also
recorded in `docs/deep-review-2026-05-29.md`.
