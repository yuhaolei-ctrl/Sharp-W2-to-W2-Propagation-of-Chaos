/-! # Derivative-free convexity from negative-intercept line intervals

The expiry condition first makes `b(t)/t` monotone. Every chord then has
nonpositive intercept, so the line-interval property controls all chords.
This is a geometric replacement for selecting a twice-differentiable tangent.

## Result

Public entry points include `boundaryRatio_monotone_of_line_intervals`, `convexOn_of_ratio_monotone_and_line_intervals`, `convexOn_of_negative_line_intervals`.
