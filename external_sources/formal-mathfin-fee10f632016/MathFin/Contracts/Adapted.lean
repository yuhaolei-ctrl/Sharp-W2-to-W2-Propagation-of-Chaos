# A payoff is measurable, and adapted to its observation times

A `Payoff` is data, not yet a random variable: `Payoff.eval` only produces one
once it is applied to a `Scenario`. This file supplies the missing link —
substitute a genuinely stochastic model `X : ι → ℝ≥0 → Ω → ℝ` for the
`Scenario`, and `fun ω ↦ e.eval (fun i t ↦ X i t ω)` is measurable
(`Payoff.measurable_eval`), and moreover `𝓕 u`-measurable as soon as every
observation the payoff makes is dated no later than `u`
(`Payoff.measurable_eval_of_obsTimes_le`). That second fact is what will make a
`Payoff` a legitimate stochastic-integral integrand: it is the adaptedness
hypothesis a future integral rung against a filtered probability space will
need. **`measurable_eval_of_obsTimes_le` has no consumer yet** —
`Contracts/Pricing.lean` integrates only against a fixed measure `Q`, never
against a filtration, so it has no adaptedness hypothesis to discharge with
this file's results.

`Payoff.aemeasurable_eval` weakens `measurable_eval`'s hypothesis from
`Measurable` to `AEMeasurable` — the strength the tower's own pricing
hypotheses actually supply (`BSCallHyp`'s `Z_law : HasLaw Z (gaussianReal 0 1)
Q` gives only `AEMeasurable Z`, never `Measurable Z`). Unlike its two
siblings, it **is** consumed: `Contracts/CappedCall.lean`'s
`integrable_europeanCall_pathPV` calls it directly, in place of hand-rolling
the same measurability argument against `bsAssets`.

## Main definitions

* `Payoff.obsTimes` — the list of times a payoff's `obs` leaves read, found by
  walking the syntax tree. It is a *syntactic* over-approximation: a payoff
  can list a time its value does not actually depend on — e.g.
  `Payoff.mul (.const 0) (.obs i t)` evaluates to `0` on every scenario, so
  `obsTimes` listing `t` overstates what the value depends on. Consequently
  the adaptedness theorem below is *sufficient*, not necessary — a payoff can
  be `𝓕 u`-adapted for reasons `obsTimes` does not see.

## Main results

* `Payoff.measurable_eval` — evaluating a payoff against a jointly-measurable
  model is measurable, unconditionally.
* `Payoff.measurable_eval_of_obsTimes_le` — if every time in `e.obsTimes` is
  `≤ u` and each `X i t` is `𝓕 t`-measurable, then evaluating `e` against `X`
  is `𝓕 u`-measurable. The filtration's monotonicity (`𝓕.mono`) does the work
  in the `obs` leaf; the six binary constructors combine two adapted pieces
  into one by the corresponding `Measurable.add`/`.sub`/`.mul`/`.max`/`.min`
  lemma, or `Measurable.ite` composed with `measurableSet_lt` for
  `indicatorLt`.
* `Payoff.aemeasurable_eval` — the same conclusion as `measurable_eval`, from
  the weaker hypothesis that each `X i t` is only `AEMeasurable`. Built from
  `measurable_eval` applied to measurable representatives `(hX i t).mk (X i
  t)`, transported across the a.e. equality `e.eval X =ᵐ[μ] e.eval X'` proved
  by a second structural induction (each `obs` leaf contributes
  `AEMeasurable.ae_eq_mk`; the six binary constructors combine two a.e. facts
  by `filter_upwards`) — not a direct induction into `AEMeasurable`, whose
  `indicatorLt` case would need a `NullMeasurableSet` this route avoids
  producing.

## Source

The layered separation of contract semantics from pricing semantics, and the
framing "the contract is not the model", are due to Paul Bilokon,
*The Contract Is Not the Model: Proof-Carrying Exotic Derivatives and the
Economics of Model Risk* (working paper, 9 August 2026; Mathematical
Finance, Imperial College London), with code at
<https://github.com/thalesians/lean_contracts> (Apache-2.0). That paper in
turn builds on the compositional contract-DSL of
Peyton Jones, Eber and Seward (2000) and the certified-contract work of Bahr,
Berthold and Elsman (2015) and Annenkov (2018).

Bilokon's `Contract.observationTimes` exists to feed a syntactic chronology
check discharged `by decide`; the same function here carries content, as the
hypothesis of an adaptedness theorem. The measurability and adaptedness
results have no counterpart in the source.

No code is copied from `lean_contracts`; every definition and proof here is
written for this library. See `docs/specs/2026-08-16-contracts-tower-design.md`
§6 for the full credit line.

/-- If a hypothesis `∀ t ∈ l₁ ++ l₂, t ≤ u` holds, it holds on each summand

/-- Evaluating a payoff against a filtration-adapted model `X` is adapted to
`𝓕 u`, as soon as every time the payoff observes is dated no later than `u`.
This is the theorem that will make a `Payoff` a legitimate stochastic-integral
integrand — the adaptedness hypothesis a future integral rung will need.
Still has no consumer: `Contracts/Pricing.lean` integrates against a fixed
measure, not a filtration, and unlike `measurable_eval`'s a.e. counterpart
above, no `Payoff` in the tower yet needs an argument observed before a fixed
time rather than a fixed measure. -/
