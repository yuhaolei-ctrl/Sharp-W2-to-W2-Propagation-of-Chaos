# Reduced-form credit risk under constant hazard rate

The simplest credit-risk model assumes a constant hazard (default-intensity)
rate `h ≥ 0`. The survival probability between `t` and `T` is

  `S(t, T) = exp(-(h · (T - t)))`,

and the resulting credit spread (additional yield over the risk-free rate)
equals the hazard rate itself:

  `c(t, T) = -log(S(t, T)) / (T - t) = h`.

This is structurally identical to the ZCB-yield identity in `ZCB.lean`
(`zcb_yield_eq_rate`), with the hazard `h` playing the role of the risk-free
rate. The continuous-time stochastic-intensity model (Cox process / doubly
stochastic Poisson) is gated on the Itô integral and is not formalized here.

Results:

* `survivalProbability`: definition.
* `survival_at_zero`: `S(T, T) = 1`.
* `survival_pos`: survival probability is positive.
* `creditSpread_eq_hazard`: under constant hazard, spread equals hazard.
* `survival_strictAnti_of_pos_hazard`: positive hazard → strictly decreasing
  survival in horizon `T`.

/-! ## CDS fair spread with recovery (folded from `CDS.lean`)

A CDS exchanges a periodic premium `c` for `(1 − R)` at default. Under
constant hazard `h` and risk-free rate `r`, both legs share the annuity
factor `(1 − e^{−(r+h) T}) / (r + h)`. Equating PVs gives the fair spread
`c = h · (1 − R)`. Specialises to `c = h` (the bare `creditSpread_eq_hazard`)
at zero recovery. -/
