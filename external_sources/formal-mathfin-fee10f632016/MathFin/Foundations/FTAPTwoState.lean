Theorem 7.1 (forward FTAP `EMM ⟹ no arbitrage`), Theorem 7.2 (signs of
no-arb implies opposite-sign components), and Theorem 7.3 (explicit EMM
construction from sign data) are adapted from Nagy's Lean 4 snippets in
the paper, restricted to the one-period, one-asset, two-state case for
concreteness. The general finite-state FTAP — both directions, multiple
assets — is in `Foundations/FTAPMultiState.lean`.

# FTAP both directions, two-state market (phase 37, after Nagy 2026)

In a one-period, one-asset market with two states (`up`, `down`) and
excess-return vector `z = (z_up, z_down)`, the **Fundamental Theorem of
Asset Pricing** asserts

  **no arbitrage  ⟺  there exists an Equivalent Martingale Measure (EMM)**.

An EMM is a probability `q = (q_up, q_down)` with `q_up, q_down ∈ (0, 1)`,
`q_up + q_down = 1`, and `q_up · z_up + q_down · z_down = 0` (zero excess
return under `Q`).

**Arbitrage** is a portfolio `θ : ℝ` with `θ · z` componentwise non-
negative and strictly positive in at least one state.

## Results

* `HasEMM_two_state`: definition of EMM existence.
* `HasArbitrage_two_state`: definition of arbitrage.
* `noArbitrage_of_emm` (Nagy 7.1, forward): EMM exists ⟹ no arbitrage.
* `emmWeightUp` / `emmWeightDown`: the named canonical backward-FTAP
  weights `−z_down / (z_up − z_down)`, `z_up / (z_up − z_down)`.
* `emm_of_signs` (Nagy 7.3, backward construction): if `z_up > 0` and
  `z_down < 0`, the named weights form an EMM.
* `emm_of_signs_swapped` / `emm_of_trivial_market`: the mirrored sign
  regime, and the trivial market `z = 0` (EMM `(1/2, 1/2)`).

*Not formalized here*: Nagy 7.2 (no arbitrage and `z ≠ 0` ⟹ opposite
strict signs) and the packaged two-state iff. The backward *construction*
is the load-bearing half: `Foundations/PricingKernel` builds the
discounted state prices directly from the named weights.

/-- **EMM existence in a two-state market**: there exists a strictly
positive probability `(q_up, q_down)` summing to `1` such that
`q_up · z_up + q_down · z_down = 0` (zero risk-neutral excess return). -/
def HasEMM_two_state (z_up z_down : ℝ) : Prop :=
  ∃ q_up q_down : ℝ,
    0 < q_up ∧ 0 < q_down ∧ q_up + q_down = 1 ∧
    q_up * z_up + q_down * z_down = 0

/-- **Arbitrage in a two-state market**: a portfolio `θ : ℝ` with `θ·z`
componentwise non-negative and strictly positive in at least one state. -/

/-- **Forward FTAP** (Nagy 2026, Theorem 7.1): if an EMM exists then
there is no arbitrage.

Proof: under EMM, any portfolio satisfies `q_up · (θ z_up) + q_down · (θ
z_down) = θ · 0 = 0`. If both terms are non-negative and one is strictly
positive, the EMM-weighted sum is strictly positive — contradiction. -/

/-- **The canonical backward-FTAP up-state weight** (Nagy 2026, Theorem 7.3):
`q_up = −z_down / (z_up − z_down)`. Named — rather than left as an
existential witness inside `emm_of_signs` — so downstream constructions
(the discounted state prices of `Foundations/PricingKernel`) can consume
the weights themselves, making their FTAP lineage definitional. -/

`z_up > 0` and `z_down < 0`, the named weights
`emmWeightUp = −z_down / (z_up − z_down)`, `emmWeightDown = z_up / (z_up −
z_down)` form an EMM. -/
