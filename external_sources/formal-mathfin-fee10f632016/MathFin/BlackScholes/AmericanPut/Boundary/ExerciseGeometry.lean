# Exercise-boundary calculus from the classical pricing contract

Smooth fit and the exercise formula give an ordinary spatial derivative at
the boundary, although no second derivative across it is asserted. Positivity
then excludes a boundary at the strike at any positive time.

## Result

Public entry points include `price_nonneg`, `price_hasDerivAt_boundary`, `boundary_neg`, `boundary_forcing_pos`.
