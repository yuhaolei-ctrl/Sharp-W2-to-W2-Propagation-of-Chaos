# Learnings

Notes from the 2026-05-22 session that pushed `docs/roadmap.md`'s
three depth-theorem candidates to completion (continuous K-convexity bridge,
multi-step Merton tree, full reflection-principle bijection — Phases 15
and 16). This document captures what worked, what was harder than expected,
and patterns worth reusing.

It is *not* a reference for what's in the library — that's `README.md`,
`docs/coverage.md`, and the source itself. It is a record of the
*how*: idioms, traps, and structural intuitions.

## Structural patterns

### Three-scale unification

A single mathematical principle often manifests at multiple scales of
resolution: payoff (discrete combinatorial), finite-state price (discrete
linear combination), continuous price (calculus). The cleanliness payoff of
formalisation is naming the principle once and writing the three scales as
corollaries.

Example: **K-convexity** of the call now lives at three scales in
`BlackScholes/StrikeConvexity.lean`:

* `convexOn_call_payoff` — payoff `K ↦ max(S − K, 0)` convex (combinatorial:
  `sup` of an affine function and zero).
* `callPrice_finiteState_convexOn_K` (in `ConvexPricingFunctional.lean`) —
  pricing under non-negative state prices preserves convexity.
* `bsV_strike_convexOn` — continuous BS price convex on `(0, ∞)` via
  `convexOn_of_deriv2_nonneg'` and the closed-form second derivative.

Before this session, the three lived as essentially independent claims.
Now the second-derivative computation in `BreedenLitzenberger.lean`
(`lognormalTerminalPDF_nonneg`) reads as "the infinitesimal face of the
same convexity," and `Spreads.lean` reads it as "the discrete face."

The pattern generalises. Wherever a property holds at a payoff level and
is preserved by a non-negative pricing functional, three scales suffice.

### One-period inequality + induction → multi-step theorem

Discrete dynamic-programming arguments lift from one period to `n` periods
by induction *if and only if* you have a monotonicity lemma for the
one-period operator. The structure:

1. Prove the substantive content as a one-period inequality
   (`call_one_period_continuation_dominates_intrinsic`).
2. Prove monotonicity of the one-period operator
   (`binomialOptionPriceOnePeriod_mono`).
3. The multi-step result is induction: at step `n+1`, the European recursion
   gives `one-period(binomialPrice n at daughters)`. By IH, the daughter
   values are bounded; by monotonicity, the bound lifts; the one-period
   inequality closes the step.

Used in `americanCallPrice_le_binomialPrice`. The Bellman-`max` structure
of `americanPrice` makes both intrinsic and continuation bounds visible.

### Algebraic-identity / counting-bijection decoupling

For combinatorial-bijection theorems, separate the *algebraic identity* on
the path level from the *counting* statement at the cardinality level. The
algebraic identity has no decidability or hitting-time prerequisites and
proves cleanly by sum decomposition. The counting bijection then uses the
identity as one ingredient and adds first-hitting-time machinery
(`Finset.min'`) for the other.

Used in `Binomial/PathReflection.lean`:

* `walkPos_reflectAfter_ge` — algebraic identity, no hitting-time anywhere.
* `firstHit`, `HitsLevel`, `reflectAtFirstHit`, `reflectionPrincipleEquiv` —
  counting layer, built on top.

The algebraic identity is what generalises. The counting layer is a clean
application; if a different reflection-style theorem needs a different
counting structure (e.g. ballot problem), the identity remains the same.

## Lean / Mathlib technical idioms

### Type-inference traps with coerced lambdas

```lean
-- WRONG (in a Finset (Fin n) context):
(Finset.univ : Finset (Fin n)).filter (fun i => (i : ℕ) < k)
-- Error: Lean picks i : ℕ from the (i : ℕ) annotation, then Finset.univ
-- has wrong type.

-- RIGHT (option 1): annotate the lambda argument
(Finset.univ : Finset (Fin n)).filter (fun (i : Fin n) => (i : ℕ) < k)

-- RIGHT (option 2): use `.val` to avoid coercion ambiguity
(Finset.univ : Finset (Fin n)).filter (fun i => i.val < k)
```

Pattern: whenever a lambda is passed to a polymorphic function and the
argument type is ambiguous, explicit annotation or `.val` resolves it.
Cost the reflection-principle file ~20 minutes of debugging until the
fix landed in one shot. Worth catching early.

### `abbrev` vs `def` for Decidable propagation

```lean
-- WRONG: blocks typeclass synthesis from seeing through.
def HitsLevel (a : ℤ) (ω : Fin n → Bool) : Prop :=
  (hittingSet ω a).Nonempty
-- Then: `if h : HitsLevel a ω then ...` fails Decidable synthesis.

-- RIGHT:
abbrev HitsLevel (a : ℤ) (ω : Fin n → Bool) : Prop :=
  (hittingSet ω a).Nonempty
-- Now `Decidable (HitsLevel a ω)` is found via `Decidable ((...).Nonempty)`.
```

`abbrev` is `@[reducible] def` — Lean's typeclass system sees through it
during instance search. `def` is opaque to the elaborator. Use `abbrev`
for predicates whose decidability comes from an underlying construction.

### `omega` and the `set` tactic

`set x := expr with x_def` introduces an alias and rewrites occurrences,
but `omega` *does not always* see through the resulting hypotheses. When
omega's counterexample-display shows two different opaque variables that
ought to be the same, the culprit is often a `set` alias not being
unfolded.

Fix: avoid `set` for the variables that flow into omega's hypotheses.
Write out the long expressions or introduce `have` lemmas first.

### `convexOn_of_deriv2_nonneg'` for open intervals

Mathlib has two variants:

* `convexOn_of_deriv2_nonneg` — wants `ContinuousOn` and differentiability
  on the *interior*. For closed intervals.
* `convexOn_of_deriv2_nonneg'` — wants differentiability on the set
  itself. For *open* sets like `Set.Ioi 0`.

`bsV_strike_convexOn` uses the `'` variant since BS is only defined for
`K > 0`. Choose the variant by domain openness.

### `HasDerivAt.congr_of_eventuallyEq` for `deriv f` identification

To prove that `deriv f` has a specific value at a point, when `f` has a
known closed-form derivative, the pattern is:

```lean
-- Local equality of derivatives in a neighborhood:
have h_ev : (fun K' => deriv f K') =ᶠ[nhds K] explicit_first_deriv := by
  filter_upwards [open_set.mem_nhds h_K_pos] with K' hK'
  exact (hasDerivAt_f hK').deriv

-- Transport HasDerivAt of the explicit form to HasDerivAt of `deriv f`:
have h_KK_for_deriv_f : HasDerivAt (deriv f) (second_deriv K) K :=
  h_KK.congr_of_eventuallyEq h_ev
```

Used in `deriv_bsV_eventuallyEq` and the third hypothesis of
`bsV_strike_convexOn`. This is *the* idiom for "second derivative via
intermediate explicit first derivative."

### `Subtype.ext` for `Equiv.left_inv` / `Equiv.right_inv`

When proving `left_inv` / `right_inv` of an `Equiv` between subtypes, a
naive `ext` may peel into pointwise function equality (since the underlying
type may be a function type), which is the wrong granularity.

```lean
-- Use:
left_inv ω := Subtype.ext (by ...)  -- the (by ...) proves val equality
```

Peels exactly one layer (Subtype to underlying value), leaving the
function-level equality to be discharged by the involution.

Used in `reflectionPrincipleEquiv`.

## Workflow patterns

### Daemon-first, lake-build-last

The Lean REPL daemon (`./scripts/lean-check.sh`) checks a single file in
5–30 s by reusing pre-loaded Mathlib oleans. Full `lake build` re-elaborates
the changed module's transitive dependents (often 5–15 minutes).

Workflow:

1. Edit a file.
2. Daemon-check it.
3. Iterate on errors until daemon green.
4. Run `lake build` once at the end (or before committing) to confirm
   cross-file integrity.

The reflection-principle file went through ~6 daemon-check iterations
before reaching `success: true`. Each iteration ~30s. Equivalent
lake-build iterations would have been ~30 minutes total instead of 3.

Caveats: the daemon doesn't write `.olean`s for downstream imports. After
the daemon green-lights a file, the umbrella import won't pick up changes
until a full `lake build` (or daemon restart). For multi-file refactors,
prefer one daemon-check per file plus a final lake build.

### Concrete LOC estimates calibrate

The roadmap predicted:

* Multi-step Merton: ~150 LOC. Actual: ~105.
* Continuous convexity: ~150 LOC. Actual: ~80 (file extension).
* Reflection principle full: ~300 LOC. Actual algebraic core ~180,
  bijection ~190 — ~370 total.

The roadmap was within ~20%. This kind of estimation matters when
deciding between "one focused session" and "spread across multiple
sessions." A 600-LOC roadmap is plausibly one session of focused work;
a 1500-LOC one is not.

### Cleanup-as-you-go beats cleanup-pass-later

The push-neg deprecation warnings in `MertonAmericanCallTree.lean` had
been pending across sessions. Folding the two replacements
(`push_neg at h` → `have h := not_le.mp h`) into the same commit as the
Phase 16-B work added ~5 lines of diff but eliminated the warnings
permanently. A dedicated cleanup pass would have been larger and harder
to motivate.

Apply: when you touch a file, fix the inline warnings if they're trivial
(< 5-minute effort each). Don't accumulate a backlog of "cleanup later"
items.

## Open opportunities

Notes on what would extend this session's work, with rough scope estimates.

### Discrete IVT for ±1 walks (~50 LOC)

The reflection-principle bijection currently requires `HitsLevel a ω` as
a hypothesis on both sides. With a discrete intermediate-value theorem
(`walkPos ω n ≥ a ⟹ HitsLevel a ω`), the right-hand side simplifies to
`{ω : walkPos ω n = 2a − b}` (no hitting condition). This unblocks the
classical **maximal-distribution theorem**

> `|{ω : max_k walkPos ω k ≥ a}| = 2 · |{ω : walkPos ω n ≥ a}| − |{ω : walkPos ω n = a}|`

which is the formula barrier-option pricers actually use.

IVT proof: induction on `n`, using `walkPos_succ` (step changes by ±1).
Likely ~50 LOC.

### Variance-optimal hedging in finite-state markets (~250 LOC)

Given a contingent claim `X : ι → ℝ` on a finite probability space and a
tradable subspace, the variance-optimal hedge is the orthogonal projection
in `L²(q)`. Concretely: minimise `E^q[(X − Δ · S)²]` over deltas in some
linear span. The minimiser is the projection.

This uses real linear algebra (orthogonal projection in inner product
space) and would establish the foundational version of the "quadratic
hedging" toolkit. Mathlib has `InnerProductSpace`, `orthogonalProjection`,
etc. — should slot in cleanly.

### First-hit on the upcrossing side (~80 LOC)

Currently `firstHit` requires `HitsLevel a ω` as a proof argument
(`(hittingSet ω a).min' h`). An alternative: define
`firstHit? ω a : Option ℕ` returning `none` for non-hit paths. This is
more ergonomic for computational reasoning and matches the typical
mathematical narrative ("the first hit, if it exists").

Could refactor `firstHit` into `firstHit?` and provide convenience
helpers. Mostly notation work, but unlocks cleaner downstream theorems.

## Anti-patterns to avoid

### "Just unfold the def" without checking what gets exposed

`unfold X at hyp` rewrites the *occurrence in `hyp`* but not in the goal.
If the goal also contains `X`, the hypothesis and goal will mention
different terms — and `omega`/`linarith` won't unify them.

Pattern that bit the `firstHit_le` proof: I had

```lean
have h_mem := (...).min'_mem h
unfold hittingSet at h_mem
-- Now h_mem talks about `(Finset.range (n+1)).filter (...)`
-- Goal still talks about `firstHit ω a h`
-- omega sees these as different opaque variables.
```

Fix: keep the hypothesis at the level of the goal's terms, and extract the
needed numeric facts via cleaner predicates.

### Multiple `set` calls in a proof passed to `omega`

`set` introduces local aliases, but their definitional unfolding is
fragile under tactics that work with hypothesis context. If a proof needs
to compare two terms that are *definitionally equal* via a `set` alias,
write out the terms explicitly rather than relying on the aliases.

### Over-folding small lemmas

The temptation when refactoring is to fold small modules into parent
files. This can hurt clarity when the small module names a distinct
principle. `BlackScholes/StrikeConvexity.lean` was *not* folded into
`StrikeGreeks.lean` despite their proximity — because K-convexity is a
*principle*, while strike Greeks are *computations*. Naming wins out
over collocation.

Conversely, the original Phase-13 modules (Quanto, CDS, etc.) *were*
folded into their parents because each was a one-shot algebraic check, not
a principle.

Rule: fold when the file is one algebraic check. Don't fold when the file
names a principle that downstream code cites.

### Wrapper lemmas around single Mathlib calls

Don't write a thin finance-specific wrapper around one Mathlib lemma. The
wrapper adds a layer of name lookup with zero structural content.

Anti-example (deleted):

```lean
-- DON'T: `pointwiseConvexCombination_eq` was a 4-line wrapper that
-- restated `ConvexOn.smul` with finance variable names. Consumers should
-- just call `ConvexOn.smul` directly.
```

Rule: if your "lemma" is `:= someMathlibLemma` with renamed arguments,
delete it and have the caller invoke the Mathlib lemma directly. The
exception is the *principle module* pattern (above), where a structural
fact is named even though its proof is short.

## Structural-reduction patterns (Phase 24+ batch)

### "This thing IS already that thing under variable renaming"

The cleanest closed-form proofs of recent phases share one shape: showing
that a seemingly-new construction is *literally* an instance of an existing
result at a different parameterisation, after which the new result is a
zero-line corollary of the old.

Phase 24 — **PowerCall**: `(S_T)^a` viewed as a standard BS terminal at
*effective spot* `S_0^a · exp((a−1)rT + a(a−1)/2 · σ²T)` and *effective
volatility* `aσ`. Then `e^{−rT} · E[max((S_T)^a − K, 0)] =
bs_call_formula(Š_0, K, r, aσ, T)` whole — no new gaussian integral.

Phase 25 — **ChooserComposition**: `chooserPrice =
bsV(K, T) + bsP(K · e^{−r(T−t_1)}, t_1)` falls out of pointwise PCP at
the chooser date + linearity of expectation. The chooser is *literally*
a portfolio of call + adjusted-strike put.

Phase 27 — **KMVMertonStructural**: KMV's `kmvPD` is *the same probability*
as the BS `bsd2`-form `Q(V_T > F)`. The pre-existing algebraic identity
`1 − kmvPD = Φ(bsd2)` is upgraded to actual probability content via
`riskNeutralProb_S_T_gt_K`.

Pattern: when a new closed form sits in front of you, before reaching for
new gaussian integration, ask "what existing closed form is this an
instance of?" If the answer is "BS-call at a different parameterisation,"
the proof reduces to algebraic identification + reuse.

This is the same discipline as the principle modules (the consumer of a
principle is its instance), one level finer-grained: each *new* closed
form ought to be an instance of an *old* one whenever the algebra allows.

### Factorisation as the bridge between calculus and algebra

When proving `HasDerivAt f f' x` for `f` of polynomial form, factorise
both `f` and `f'` aggressively before reaching for `convert` or
`linear_combination`. The proofs collapse when Lean can match the factored
forms term-by-term.

Used in `DurationSensitivity.lean` (`hasDerivAt_coupon_term`):
the per-cashflow derivative `d/dy [c / (1+y)^n] = −n c / (1+y)^{n+1}`
bundles the `n = 0` and `n ≥ 1` cases by `field_simp + ring` *after*
factoring out the common `c / (1+y)^{n+1}`. Without factoring, ring
hits a polynomial-degree blowup; with factoring, it's one line.

Same shape in `ConvexitySensitivity.lean` (`hasDerivAt_modNum_term`):
the second derivative is the first derivative applied a second time, with
factored intermediates.

Rule: aggressive `field_simp` *before* `ring`; `push_cast` *before*
`field_simp` if there are `Nat.cast` numerals.

## Workflow additions

### Push to completion when ~80% done

Mid-derivation stopping points are expensive: the proof state is in your
head but not on disk. If you're 80% through a multi-step derivation and
the remaining 20% is mostly algebra-chasing, push to completion rather
than leave a `sorry` for "later." Future-you opening the file cold has to
re-load the entire proof context, which usually costs more than just
finishing in the current session.

Counterexample (don't do this): leaving `sorry` placeholders in
load-bearing files. They block downstream consumers and pollute
`#print axioms`. Use `sorry` only in scratch / exploratory files that
won't be imported.

### Cleanup pass after every major proof

After landing a multi-hundred-line proof, do a structural −10–20% line
trim before closing the milestone. The first version of a complex proof
tends to over-decompose intermediate steps; the second pass folds them
back together. The discipline keeps the codebase from accreting noise.

Concrete evidence: `proposals/bm-martingales/Martingale.lean` went from
392 → 292 lines (−25%) as a single cleanup commit after the proof
mechanics landed.

### Match domain choice to target benchmark FIRST

When formalising an upstream-targeted result, decide the domain / index
type / Lp exponent based on what the *target benchmark* expects, *before*
writing the supporting infrastructure. Choosing first and writing second
saves a refactor pass.

Concrete evidence: the L^p continuous-martingale-convergence work shipped
with `p : ℝ`-indexed `eLpNorm` because that's what `Mathlib.MeasureTheory`
takes. An earlier version with `p : ℕ≥1` had to be rewritten.

## Upgrade-properly patterns (2026-06-04 batch)

Patterns from the Path-1 session that converted seven reduced cores to full
derivations (optional sampling inequality, covariance-PSD, Rockafellar–Uryasev,
Newton convergence, KMV survival, the American/Snell pair).

### Pointwise-certificate minimality

To prove a variational characterization `m = min_c g(c)` — attained at `c*` —
hunt for a *pointwise* inequality whose integral collapses to `m` for *every*
`c`, with equality exactly at `c*`. No calculus, no convexity machinery, no
derivative of the objective.

Concrete: Rockafellar–Uryasev (`RiskMeasures/RockafellarUryasev.lean`). The
certificate is `(L − c)⁺ ≥ (L − c)·𝟙_{Z > z}` (the `α`-tail event); integrating
against the Gaussian density gives `g(c) ≥ CVaR` in three integral evaluations,
and at `c = VaR` the positive part vanishes exactly off the tail — equality.
The certificate *is* the reason the minimum sits at VaR; a `deriv`-based proof
would hide it.

### Linearization-subtracted integral remainder

Second-order Taylor control from *first-order* tools, at the sharp constant:
to bound `f y − f x − f'(x)(y − x)`, apply the FTC
(`intervalIntegral.integral_eq_sub_of_hasDerivAt`) to the auxiliary
`g w := f w − f'(x)·w` on the segment — its derivative is `f' w − f'(x)`,
which a Lipschitz hypothesis on `f'` bounds by `L·|w − x|`, *linear* in the
distance to `x`. Integrating the linear bound gives `(L/2)·|y − x|²` — the
sharp Newton–Kantorovich constant — with no `ContDiff`, no `iteratedDeriv`,
no second derivative anywhere. (The uniform mean-value bound
`Convex.norm_image_sub_le_of_norm_hasDerivWithin_le` proves the same shape
but doubles the constant: the derivative deviation *vanishes at* `x`, and
only the integral sees that.)

Concrete: `newtonStep_quadratic_error` (`BlackScholes/NewtonConvergence.lean`)
— the whole "Newton is quadratic at `L/(2m)`" content is this plus the
error–times–derivative identity `(x⁺ − r)·f'(x) = f'(x)(x − r) − f(x)`.

### Inequality = equality + monotone part (decomposition transport)

To upgrade an *equality* theorem about martingales to the *inequality* version
for submartingales, do not re-run the equality's proof with inequalities
threaded through. Doob-decompose `f = M + A`, transport the equality on `M`
(Mathlib's theorem, consumed as-is), prove the compensator `A` monotone
(its increments are `μ[f_{k+1} − f_k | ℱ_k] ≥ 0` — literally the submartingale
property), and recombine with `condExp_mono`.

Concrete: `submartingale_optional_sampling`
(`Foundations/OptionalSamplingInequality.lean`) = Mathlib's
`Martingale.stoppedValue_ae_eq_condExp_of_le` + `predictablePart` monotonicity.
The decomposition is the *conceptual* picture, and the proof is exactly it.

### Identification theorems ground scalar recursions in path space

When the library holds a scalar/Markov recursion (a function of the current
state) and the textbook theorem is about an adapted *process* on paths, do not
rebuild the scalar layer. Build the path-space object abstractly, prove its
clauses there (dominance, supermartingale, adaptedness, minimality), then prove
ONE induction — the identification `scalar recursion = discounted path object`
— and every clause transports to the scalar object for free.

Concrete: `snellAux_eq_discounted_americanPrice`
(`Binomial/SnellEnvelope.lean`): `snell q Z N k ω = e^{−rk}·americanPrice
(N−k) (S_k ω)`. Four abstract Snell clauses + one induction = the genuine
supermartingale/intrinsic statements about `americanPrice`, with the
node-average conditional expectation made explicit. Same instrument as the
"this IS already that" structural reduction, but for *recursions* rather than
single formulas.

## In-Lean automation: `grind` (2026-06-06 batch)

Empirical trial of the core `grind` tactic (in toolchain since 4.22; we are
on 4.30) against 17 goals extracted verbatim from MathFin proof sites. The
boundary is sharp and worth internalizing.

### Where grind wins — make it the first call

8/10 in its lane, including goals our current proofs work harder for:

* **Field identities with `≠ 0` side conditions** — the full risk-parity
  contribution identity (`Portfolio/RiskParity.lean`) closes by bare `grind`,
  *including the un-normalized form with commuted denominators*
  (`σ₁ + σ₂` and `σ₂ + σ₁` mixed) that forces a manual
  `rw [show σ₂ + σ₁ = σ₁ + σ₂ from by ring]` before `field_simp; ring`.
  Congruence closure absorbs the commutation; the denominator non-vanishing
  is consumed from the hypothesis.
* **Division goals with ℕ-cast denominators** — the telescoping increment
  `(k+1)·t/(n+1) − k·t/(n+1) = t/(n+1)` closes with *no* explicit
  `(n:ℝ) + 1 ≠ 0` hypothesis: grind derives it from cast nonnegativity.
* **Goals linear in nonlinear atoms** — `1 − cos u = 2·sin(u/2)²` from the
  double-angle + Pythagorean hypotheses (atoms `cos u`, `sin(u/2)²`,
  `cos(u/2)²` enter linearly). Our proof used `nlinarith [h2, h3]`; grind
  needs no hints.
* **ℕ arithmetic** (truncated subtraction, cast pushing) — subsumes `omega`
  via cutsat.

### Where grind loses — keep nlinarith

0/7 on nonlinear *real inequalities* (power-mean `(e+f+g)² ≤ 3(e²+f²+g²)`,
`w² ≤ w` on `[0,1]`, `t² ≤ 4s²` from `t/2 < s`, products of hypotheses like
`a ≤ b → 0 ≤ z → az ≤ bz`). This is exactly the FRO's in-progress Year-3
nonlinear-arithmetic workstream — re-test on future toolchain bumps.

Passing the nlinarith certificates as grind parameters
(`grind [sq_nonneg (e - f), …]`) recovers *some* of these (the power-mean
closes), but fails where nlinarith multiplies hypotheses *together*
(`w² ≤ w` needs `w·(1−w) ≥ 0`, a product of `h0` and `h1` — grind does not
search hypothesis products). Hint-for-hint, nlinarith remains strictly
stronger on this class.

### Trap

The `unusedVariables` linter false-positives on binders consumed only inside
grind-generated proof terms (a `≠ 0` hypothesis the proof genuinely needs gets
flagged unused). Kernel-checked soundness is unaffected; don't "fix" the
warning by deleting the hypothesis — the proof breaks.

Authoring order going forward: `grind` → (if nonlinear-inequality shaped)
`nlinarith [certificates]` → `positivity`/`gcongr`/`bound` for the structured
inequality families.

## Canonical forms (2026-06-09, values round 6)

**Discount-factor exponent**: in NEW files write `Real.exp (-(r * τ))` —
the parenthesised product under one negation, the repo's 2:1 majority form.
`Call.lean`-era `Real.exp (-r * T)` is grandfathered: the realized cost of
the split is exactly three `neg_mul` reconciliations at the bridges
(`PDEFromFeynmanKac` ×2, `MertonJumpDiffusion` ×1), accepted permanently in
round 6 — a unifying sweep would re-stale a large ledger slice for zero
mathematical content.

## Mathlib house-style golf (2026-07-10, BM PR #484 maintainer review)

Distilled from a BrownianMotion maintainer's review of our upstream PR #484
(`isStoppingTime_tauMeshLift` + `tendsto_iSup_setIntegral_tauMesh_zero` in
`DoobMeyer.lean`). The review was ALL idiomatic golf plus one architectural
lift — no math errors — so it reads as the repo's binding house style. Every
item was verified compiling at the v4.31.0 pin. These map directly onto our own
zero-slop / idiomatic-register / coherence / concept-clarity lenses; adopt them
in MathFin proofs too, not just upstream contributions.

### The golf checklist (most transferable first)

1. **Bare proof term over `by exact` / `by exact_mod_cast`.** If `h : A` and the
   goal is defeq to `A`, pass `h`. A subtype `mesh ι n = {x : ι // x ∈ …}` has
   `v ≤ u` *defeq* to `(↑v : ι) ≤ ↑u`, so `le_trans hv hu` needs no cast. A stray
   `exact_mod_cast` usually masks an already-defeq coercion.
2. **Let Lean insert coercions; never hand-write them.** `WithTop ι`,
   subtype→base, `ℝ≥0 → ℝ`, `⊥`/`⊤` coercions elaborate from context in `≤`,
   set-builder, and argument position: `{ω | f ω ≤ (s : WithTop ι)}` → `… ≤ s`;
   `fun c => (c : ℝ) / 2` → `fun c => c / 2`; `fun u => ((u : ι) ≤ s)` →
   `fun u => u ≤ s`.
3. **Bind ∀-vars in the `have` signature, not via `intro`.**
   `have h (v : T) : P v := by …` beats `have h : ∀ v, P v := by intro v; …`.
4. **Fold `have h := e; simp … at h; exact h` into `simpa … using e`.**
5. **No gratuitous `classical`.** `LinearOrder ι` already gives `DecidableLE`, so
   `Finset.univ.filter (· ≤ s)` needs none. Reach for it only for a genuinely
   nonconstructive `Decidable`/choice.
6. **`set x := e with hx` only if you rewrite with `hx`.** To merely unfold `x`
   inside the proof, drop `with hx` and use `simp [x]` (the local def is
   simp-usable). Fewer named artifacts; often deletes a helper `have` outright.
7. **Minimal typeclass, matching neighbours.** Don't assume `IsFiniteMeasure`
   when the callees need only `SigmaFiniteFiltration`; check each dependency's
   actual requirement. Instance implications
   (`[IsFiniteMeasure μ] → SigmaFiniteFiltration μ 𝓕`) mean weakening a lemma
   never breaks a stronger-hypothesis caller. Over-assuming is a coherence smell.
8. **Fewer `have`s; mix forward + backward reasoning** (`suffices`,
   `show … from`, `simp`/`simpa`) so the argument's SHAPE stays visible. A long
   ladder of `have`s hides structure. (Balance against concept-clarity — don't
   over-golf past readability.)
9. **Lift the reusable abstraction; don't tailor the proof to one call site.**
   The review's headline. Extract the bespoke ε–δ core into a general,
   Mathlib-worthy lemma
   (`UniformIntegrable.eLpNorm_tendsto_zero_of_iSup_measure_tendsto_zero`), prove
   it once, apply it. Work out the honest side-conditions — here just
   measurability of the sets: because the lemma consumes `UniformIntegrable X p μ`
   directly it inherits any `p` (the `ε = ∞` case falls to `le_top`), so despite
   the reviewer's hint NO `p ≠ ∞` is needed. This is our anti-wrapper /
   consume-the-idiomatic-lemma value aimed at our own code.
10. **Delete parens the parser doesn't need.**
11. **`↦` over `=>` in `fun` and binders** (a leanprover-community style-guide
    rule). Keep a single declaration internally consistent; the file at large
    mixes the two.
12. **Collapse a trivial two-step `calc` into one term.** A `calc` whose second
    step is just an equality (`… ≤ x := h; _ = y := heq`) is `h.trans_eq heq`
    (or `.trans`) — drop the `calc` entirely. If a `calc` genuinely stays, the
    `calc` keyword goes on its own line when the head term/relation wraps.
13. **Squeeze, don't ε–δ, for `Tendsto _ _ (𝓝 0)`.** A hand-rolled
    `rw [ENNReal.tendsto_nhds_zero]; intro ε …; filter_upwards …` collapses to
    `tendsto_of_tendsto_of_tendsto_of_le_of_le' tendsto_const_nhds hbound
    (Eventually.of_forall fun _ ↦ zero_le) …` once you have an eventual upper
    bound that itself → 0 — e.g. `C / ENNReal.ofReal (b c)` via
    `ENNReal.tendsto_ofReal_atTop` + `ENNReal.Tendsto.const_div`. The squeeze
    reads as the actual argument (`0 ≤ ⨆ ≤ C/(b c) → 0`).

### Local-build gotchas hit while verifying (transferable)

- `set x := e` (no `with`) makes `x` opaque to `simpa [T] using <term>` when the
  term mentions `e` unfolded — `simp [T]` rewrote `T` *inside* `T.max'`, so
  `↑({…}.max')` no longer matched the goal's folded `↑x`. Fix: bind `x ∈ T` first
  (`have hu_mem : u ∈ T := T.max'_mem hTne`), THEN `simpa [T]` unfolds only the
  filter, leaving `x` intact.
- `ae_all_iff.2 fun t => ht t` needs the index type pinned, or Lean infers it as
  the uncountable base `ι` → `Countable ι` synthesis failure. Ascribe the BINDER —
  `ae_all_iff.2 fun t : mesh ι k ↦ ht t` — which then inlines straight into
  `filter_upwards [...]` with no separate `have : ∀ᵐ ω, ∀ t : mesh ι k, …`.
- `UniformIntegrable` is a `def` reducing to `And`, so `hd.myLemma` dot-notation
  resolves against `And` (`invalidField`). Call `UniformIntegrable.myLemma hd …`
  by full name; positional field access `hd.2.1` for the `UnifIntegrable`
  component is fine.
- `hv.trans h` (dot notation) FAILS where `le_trans hv h` succeeds when the middle
  term needs a subtype→base coercion: dot resolves `.trans` against `hv`'s type
  (`mesh ι n`), pinning the middle to `mesh ι n` and refusing `↑u : ι`. Use the
  `le_trans` / `_root_.`-qualified form so the expected type drives the coercion.
  This is the flip side of item 1 — the coercion IS defeq, but only when
  elaboration is expected-type-driven, which dot notation defeats.
- Deleting a declaration ORPHANS its preceding `omit …/include …/attribute … in`
  modifier onto the NEXT declaration. If that next declaration is a `variable (…)`,
  the modifier silently breaks the variable's registration, so under `lake build`
  (`autoImplicit` false) every later use of that variable is an "Unknown identifier"
  — a whole-file cascade from one root cause. The warm daemon (`autoImplicit` TRUE)
  MASKS it. When deleting a lemma, check the line above for an `omit … in` and
  delete it too. (2026-07-10: hoisting a lemma out of `GirsanovAdaptedTheta` orphaned
  its `omit` onto `variable (hB …)` → 60+ `hB`-unknown errors.)
- `have h := e; simp only [L] at h; exact h` does NOT always fold to
  `simpa only [L] using e`. When `exact h` was closing by full defeq — instance-path
  differences (`HasDerivAt.const_mul` producing the `NormedAlgebra` path vs the
  goal's plain `AddCommGroup`), or `id` unfolding — `simpa`'s weaker post-simp
  matching fails with a type mismatch. Build-verify every simpa-fold; the daemon's
  `lean-check` can pass one that `lake build` later rejects.

## Provenance header for source-consulted proofs

When a proof is developed with an external formalization or textbook as a *source*
(not a template — our design and Mathlib idiom lead; see the values doctrine), the file
carries an attribution block in its copyright header and the benchmark entry a machine-checkable
provenance marker, so the "our design, source consulted" claim is honest and cannot drift.

- **File header** (after `Authors:`), e.g. `MathFin/Actuarial/SurvivalModel.lean`:
  > The definitions and proofs here are our own, following this library's conventions … `<Source>`
  > … was consulted as a source for the classical result set, and is cited here with thanks and
  > with the author's kind permission.

  State the design as OURS; cite the source with its license and (where applicable) the author's
  permission. Never "Mathematical design © <them>" or "translated/re-formalized from".
- **Benchmark entry**: `metadata.provenance.source: "<slug>"` (e.g. `afp-actuarial-mathematics`),
  optionally `issue` + `upstream`. `tools/formalization_yaml.py` counts these per source and emits a
  mechanical disclosure ("N proof(s) authored in our own design, with … consulted as a source and
  cited"); `tests/test_formalization_yaml.py` pins the count so it tracks the live corpus.
- **coverage.md**: one disclosure line per source-consulted batch.

## Continuous-time FTAP / conditional-expectation idioms (2026-07-11 batch)

Distilled from the continuous first-FTAP frame (`Foundations/ContinuousMarket.lean`).

### Bilinear `condExp` pull-out for predictable-weighted martingale increments
The building block of the forward FTAP — "a `𝓕_s`-measurable bounded weight against a martingale
increment integrates to `0`" — is Mathlib's **`condExp_bilin_of_stronglyMeasurable_left`**
(`Mathlib/MeasureTheory/Function/ConditionalExpectation/PullOut.lean`):
`Q[fun ω ↦ B (φ ω) (g ω) | m] =ᵐ fun ω ↦ B (φ ω) (Q[g | m] ω)` for `φ` `m`-strongly-measurable.
- `B` must be a **continuous** bilinear map `F →L[ℝ] E →L[ℝ] G`. For the real inner product use
  **`innerSL ℝ`** (`⟪·,·⟫_ℝ`), NOT `innerₗ` (that is only `→ₗ`, and the pull-out needs `→L`).
- Then `∫ ⟪φ, Δ⟫ dQ = ∫ Q[⟪φ,Δ⟫|𝓕_s] dQ` (`integral_condExp`) `= ∫ ⟪φ, Q[Δ|𝓕_s]⟫ dQ` (pull-out
  under `integral_congr_ae`) `= 0`, since `Q[S t − S s | 𝓕 s] = 0` for a martingale.
- Increment integrability: Cauchy–Schwarz `‖⟪φ,Δ⟫‖ ≤ ‖φ‖·‖Δ‖ ≤ K·‖Δ‖` + `Integrable.mono'` with
  `AEStronglyMeasurable.inner`; `Martingale.integrable i` gives `Integrable (S i) Q`.

### `Martingale` is a bare `And` on this pin — `.1`/`.2`, and `.adapted` does NOT exist
`Martingale f 𝓕 μ := StronglyAdapted 𝓕 f ∧ ∀ i j, i ≤ j → μ[f j | 𝓕 i] =ᵐ[μ] f i`. So:
- adaptedness is **`hS.1 i : StronglyMeasurable[𝓕 i] (f i)`** (via the `And`) — `hS.adapted` errors
  with `And.adapted` (mirrors the `UniformIntegrable`-is-a-`def` gotcha above);
- the tower is **`hS.2 i j hij`**; the named lemmas `Martingale.condExp_ae_eq` and
  `Martingale.integrable` DO exist and are fine to use by dot notation.

### Sub-namespace variant frames — and the build gate, not the daemon, catches the collision
`MathFin.IsEMM` already exists (`FTAPDiscrete`). A second `IsEMM` under bare `namespace MathFin`
collides. Variant frames sub-namespace: `MathFin.OnePeriod`, `MathFin.OnePeriodVector`, and now
`MathFin.ContinuousMarket`. The isolated warm-daemon `lean-check` PASSES (it never loads the sibling
module), so only `lake build MathFin` (the umbrella) surfaces
`environment already contains 'MathFin.IsEMM'`. One more entry in the daemon-masks / build-verifies
column: name collisions join `autoImplicit` and instance-path `simpa`-folds there.

### Lift the shared *vanishing* primitive, let each setting supply its own zero-integral
When two forward-FTAP settings both close through "nonneg + `∫ = 0` ⟹ positive set is null,"
extract exactly THAT (`ae_zero_of_nonneg_of_integral_zero`, `Foundations/NoArbitrageCore.lean`) and
let each side reach `∫ = 0` its own way — the discrete one via a martingale transform started at `0`
(`∫ V_T = ∫ V_0 = 0`), the continuous one term-by-term via the pull-out. Do NOT force a
martingale-shaped shared lemma onto the continuous setting, which has no martingale to hand: that
was the plan's first cut, and it produced an over-general core whose docstring overclaimed its
consumers. Match the abstraction to what is actually shared.

### CI runs `lake lint`, `lake build MathFin` does NOT (docBlame on struct data fields)
A green local `lake build MathFin` can still push RED: CI (`build.yml` via `lean-action`) also runs
`lake lint` (Batteries `runLinter` over `MathFin`), the same env-linters Mathlib uses. The common
new-`structure` catch is **`docBlame`: every non-`Prop` DATA field needs a `/-- … -/` docstring**
(`SimpleStrategy`'s `N`/`time`/`hold` failed; the `Prop` fields `mono`/`meas`/`bdd` and the `Prop`
structure `IsEMM` are exempt). Run `lake build MathFin && lake lint` (daemon DOWN) before pushing —
and REBUILD first: `runLinter` reads the olean's doc metadata, so linting after only a docstring
edit lints the stale olean and re-reports the old failures at the old line numbers.

### Small syntax pointers
- `Fin.castSucc_lt_succ` takes `i` **implicit** — `(Fin.castSucc_lt_succ (i := i)).le`, or let it
  unify; do NOT apply it to `i` positionally (`... i` → "function expected").
- `condExp_of_stronglyMeasurable hm hf hint : Q[f | m] = f` is a real **`=`**, not `=ᵐ`; use it in
  `rw`, or lift with `.symm ▸` where an `=ᵐ` is expected.
- `integrable_finsetSum` / `integral_finsetSum` are the current spellings; the `_finset_sum` forms
  are deprecated (the daemon is silent, `lake build` warns — fix on sight, zero-slop).

## Market-making Riccati / calculus idioms (2026-07-16 batch)

### Mathlib has no `tanh` calculus at this pin (v4.31.0)
- `loogle 'Real.tanh, HasDerivAt'` → **0 results**; `Real.deriv_tanh` absent. Derive it:
  `hasDerivAt_tanh x : HasDerivAt Real.tanh (1 - Real.tanh x ^ 2) x` from `Real.tanh_eq_sinh_div_cosh`
  + `HasDerivAt.div` (`sinh`/`cosh`, `cosh x ≠ 0` via `Real.cosh_pos`). The `tanh → 1` limit at `atTop`
  is also absent — defer it (or build via `tanh x = 1 - 2/(exp(2x)+1)`) if it isn't on the critical path.
- `HasDerivAt.div` yields the function as **`sinh / cosh` (Pi-div), not `fun y => sinh y / cosh y`**, and
  `Real.tanh`'s defeq to `sinh/cosh` is **not exposed for `exact`** — rewrite the goal's *value* to the
  div-form, rewrite the head with `funext … Real.tanh_eq_sinh_div_cosh`, then `field_simp; ring`.

### `HasDerivAt` combinators build Pi-level functions — annotate to collapse `convert`
- `hA.neg.mul_const c`, `.sub`, … produce `((-A) * c - B) - C` (Pi `Sub`/`Neg`), NOT a single `fun s => …`.
  So `convert h using 1` against a `fun s => …` goal leaves a spurious **function-equality** subgoal, and
  `field_simp`/`ring` then report **"made no progress"** (they're staring at a function goal, not an equation).
  Fix: give the `have` the single-lambda **type annotation** (defeq to the combinator term via `Pi.sub`/`Pi.neg`
  unfolding) so `convert … using 1` leaves ONLY the derivative-value goal. Diagnose a stuck `convert` with
  `exact h` — the type-mismatch prints both the combinator's Pi-form and the target lambda.

### Polynomial identity with `1/(2z)`: `field_simp` needs a beta-reduced goal + nonzero facts
- `ring` alone can't cancel `z²/(2z) = z/2` (no `z ≠ 0`); `field_simp` must clear it first, and it also needs
  `z ≠ 0` / `2*z ≠ 0` in context and no `(fun y => …) x` residue. The `field_simp; ring` closure of such a
  verification **self-certifies** hand-derived coefficients — a wrong sign/coefficient fails `ring`, so a green
  build IS the check (used for the market-making `B`/`C` ODE right-hand sides).

### `axiom_audit_gen` pins `:= MathFin.X` re-export HEADS only
- A benchmark proved by an anonymous constructor `:= ⟨MathFin.a …, MathFin.b …⟩` gets **none** of its cited
  constants auto-pinned (the gen matches `:=\s*\(*\s*MathFin\.…`). Fine when they're trivial + ledger-covered;
  add to the curated `AxiomAudit.lean` if you want them pinned.

### ★ Review subagents must NOT touch the daemon
- A review subagent that runs `./scripts/lean-check.sh` / `docker` will bring the lean-repl daemon up **and tear
  it back down**, killing the controller's warmed daemon. Instruct review subagents to **read files only — never
  run docker/lake/lean-check**. (Cost a daemon restart mid-run.)

## Matrix Riccati via spectral reduction (2026-07-16, multi-asset follow-on)

The matrix analogue of `a(t) = Â·tanh(Â(T−t))` (BEGV Prop. 2, `MatrixMarketMakingRiccati.lean`), with
**no matrix `tanh`/`exp`** (both absent at the pin) and **no Mathlib matrix-differentiation** (also absent).

### Spectral reduction — define diagonalised, reduce the ODE per eigenvalue
- For Hermitian `Â = U·diag(λ)·Uᴴ` (`U = hÂ.eigenvectorUnitary`, `λ = hÂ.eigenvalues`), **define** the matrix
  function as `U · diagonal (fun i => <scalar closed form> (λ i)) · star U`. Then the matrix ODE reduces, on each
  eigenvalue, to the already-proven *scalar* lemma. No matrix transcendental is ever built.
- `Matrix.IsHermitian.spectral_theorem` at this pin is stated via `conjStarAlgAut` (namespace **`Unitary`**):
  `A = Unitary.conjStarAlgAut 𝕜 _ hA.eigenvectorUnitary (diagonal (RCLike.ofReal ∘ hA.eigenvalues))`, and
  `Unitary.conjStarAlgAut_apply` is `@[simp] rfl`: `u * x * star u`.
- `conjStarAlgAut U` is a `⋆`-alg hom ⇒ **`map_mul`** collapses conjugated products with zero `star U*U=1`
  juggling: `Â*Â = U·diag(λ)·star U · U·diag(λ)·star U = U·diag(λ²)·star U` via
  `conv_lhs => rw [hÂ.spectral_theorem]; rw [← map_mul, diagonal_mul_diagonal, Unitary.conjStarAlgAut_apply]`.
  (Over ℝ, `RCLike.ofReal ∘ λ` cleans up with `simp [Function.comp, sq]`.)

### Matrix-valued `HasDerivAt` — open the operator norm, lift `diagonalLinearMap`
- Mathlib has **no** `HasDerivAt` for matrix-valued maps and **no default** norm on `Matrix` (diamond avoidance).
  `open scoped Matrix.Norms.Operator` (the `L∞` operator norm — `NormedRing` + `NormedAlgebra`) turns
  `HasDerivAt.const_mul U`, `.mul_const (star U)`, `.const_smul c` on matrices on. The operator-norm
  `AddCommGroup` is **defeq** to the default `Matrix.addCommGroup`, so a goal stated with the default instance is
  closed by `exact` (not `simpa`) after the derivative is built.
- Diagonal-core derivative: `hasDerivAt_pi.2 (fun i => <scalar deriv>)` for the Pi part, then lift through
  `(Matrix.diagonalLinearMap (R:=ℝ) (n:=n) (α:=ℝ)).toContinuousLinearMap.hasFDerivAt (x := g t)`
  `|>.comp_hasDerivAt t hpi`, close with `simp only [Function.comp_def]; exact`. (`ContinuousLinearMap.hasFDerivAt`
  needs its point `x` supplied — bind it to `g t`.)
- Conjugation-preserves-Hermitian: `isHermitian_mul_mul_conjTranspose B hA : (B·A·Bᴴ).IsHermitian`, with
  `isHermitian_diagonal` (real ⇒ `TrivialStar`) and `star M = Mᴴ` via `star_eq_conjTranspose`.

### Change-of-variables / positive-diagonal collapses (M2)
- `diagonal (√dᵢ)⁻¹ * diagonal (√dᵢ) = 1`: `diagonal_mul_diagonal` + `inv_mul_cancel₀ (Real.sqrt_ne_zero'.2 (hd i))`
  + `diagonal_one`. For `D₊^{-½}·D₊·D₊^{-½}=1` the funext goal after `field_simp` is `d i = √(d i) ^ 2` → close
  with **`Real.sq_sqrt (hd i).le`** (not `Real.mul_self_sqrt`, which is `√·√`).
- Reassociate a sandwiched product `(Dm·a·Dm)·X·(Dm·a·Dm) = Dm·a·(Dm·X·Dm)·a·Dm` with `simp only [Matrix.mul_assoc]`
  (both sides normalise to the same right-associated factor sequence), then collapse the centre with the `=1` lemma.
- **ℕ vs ℝ smul**: a bare `2 • M` defaults to **ℕ**-smul, which `smul_smul` (single scalar action) can't fuse with
  a `(1/2 : ℝ) •`. Write `(2 : ℝ) •` in the statement when the proof does smul algebra.
- `pow_two` bridges `x*x` (from `diagonal_mul_diagonal`) and `x^2` inside a `diagonal (fun i => …)` equality —
  `simp only [pow_two]` makes both sides identical, avoiding a `ring` on the post-`congr` shape (which emits a
  spurious noncommutative "Try this: ring_nf" **info** even though the build is kernel-valid).
- **`Σ` is a reserved token** (Sigma types) — never an identifier; name the covariance `cov`. (Also [[girsanov]]:
  never capital Σ in idents.)

## Extending an isometry to an `L²` closure — `extendOfNorm` into a submodule (2026-07-18 batch)

From the Itô–Lévy integral CLM (`Foundations/PoissonCompensatedIntegralOperator`): building
`f.extendOfNorm e : Eₗ →L F` where the dense domain `Eₗ` is a *submodule* of the ambient `L²`, not a
full space. The continuous Itô CLM dodged this by making its codomain a full `Lp` of a bespoke
trimmed measure; when you instead extend to a `Submodule.topologicalClosure`, these are the traps.

### Target-as-closure makes density soft — no bespoke `σ`-algebra
- To extend `emb : E →ₗ Lp` by continuity you need `DenseRange`. Rather than characterise which `L²`
  functions are hit (a from-scratch predictable `σ`-algebra), **define the target as the closure of
  the range**: `levyClosure := (LinearMap.range emb).topologicalClosure`, `embCorestrict :=
  emb.codRestrict levyClosure (fun V => Submodule.le_topologicalClosure _ (mem_range_self _ V))`.
- `DenseRange embCorestrict` is then a *soft* topological fact: `Topology.IsInducing.subtypeVal.dense_iff`
  reduces it to `↑x ∈ closure (Subtype.val '' range embCorestrict)`; the image is `↑(range emb)`
  (`← Set.range_comp; rfl`), whose closure is `↑levyClosure` **by construction**
  (`← LinearMap.coe_range, ← Submodule.topologicalClosure_coe`), and `x.2` finishes. No induction, no
  `σ`-algebra.
- v4.31.0 names (loogle misses several — the `Inducing→IsInducing` rename put them under `Topology`):
  `Topology.IsInducing` / `.subtypeVal` / `.dense_iff`, `Submodule.topologicalClosure_coe`
  (`↑s.topologicalClosure = closure ↑s`), `LinearMap.coe_range` (NOT `range_coe`),
  `Submodule.coe_norm` (`‖x‖ = ‖↑x‖`, a `rfl` `simp` lemma), `Submodule.le_topologicalClosure` (takes
  the submodule explicitly), `denseRange_inclusion_iff`.

### ★ The submodule-codomain instance diamond (and how to bridge it)
- `extendOfNorm` needs `[SeminormedAddCommGroup Eₗ]`, which derives `Eₗ`'s `AddCommMonoid` via the
  **`AddCommGroup`** path; a bare `_ →ₗ[ℝ] ↥sub` picks `Submodule.addCommMonoid` (the semiring path).
  On `↥(Submodule …)` these are defeq (the norm/module instances would not typecheck otherwise) but
  **not at the transparency the elaborator uses for the explicit `LinearMap` `AddCommMonoid` argument**
  → a bare `f.extendOfNorm e` fails with an "application type mismatch" on the `AddCommMonoid` slot.
  `set_option backward.isDefEq.respectTransparency false` does **not** help.
- **Bridge for a `def`**: state it as a tactic block and let the *goal type* pin the instances —
  `refine LinearMap.extendOfNorm (E := ↥Src) (F := Cod) f ?_; exact e`. The CLM goal
  `Eₗ →L[ℝ] F` fixes `Eₗ = ↥levyClosure` with its seminormed-group instances, so `exact e` is a single
  cheap `isDefEq` at default transparency. (`f.extendOfNorm (by exact e)` alone is "stuck, goal has
  metavariables" — `E` isn't pinned yet inside the argument.)
- **Bridge for the downstream norm lemma**: `unfold <thedef>` to expose the def's *already-bridged*
  `extendOfNorm` term, then `exact norm_extendOfNorm_eq_of_isometry hdense key H` — but the lemma app
  re-triggers the diamond `whnf`, which is heavy-but-**finite** (~50 s), so wrap the theorem in
  `set_option maxHeartbeats 1000000 in`. `key : ∀ V, ‖f V‖ = ‖e V‖` via `rw [Submodule.coe_norm]`
  (drop the subtype norm to the ambient one) `; exact <the isometry on the dense range>`.

### Workflow: relocating a lemma restales its whole transitive importer set
- The jump tower must not import `WienerIntegral` (it pulls in `BrownianMotion`), so the shared kernel
  `norm_extendOfNorm_eq_of_isometry` was lifted into a new `Mathlib`-only leaf
  `Foundations/ExtendOfNormIsometry.lean`, re-imported (and re-exported) by `WienerIntegral` and
  imported by the operator file. **Cost**: changing `WienerIntegral`'s *source* restaled **every**
  ledger entry that transitively imports it (the whole Itô/finance chain — 36 entries, a ~50-min
  daemon `ledger verify`). Lift-to-a-shared-leaf is the right call for a genuinely generic kernel, but
  budget the re-verify; if the tree is hot and the lemma is one-off, keeping it local is cheaper.

## Statement design (for the formalizer / drafter) (2026-07-18)

The drafter's job is a faithful, in-depth *statement* — the hardest failures are
not proof failures but statement failures. Design for these before writing `:= by
sorry`.

- **Shape hard side-conditions to be inherited, not asserted.** When the object is
  a limit/closure, define it inside a class closed under the operation so the
  condition is free: `levyClosure := (LinearMap.range emb).topologicalClosure` makes
  `DenseRange` a soft `IsInducing.subtypeVal.dense_iff` fact — no bespoke σ-algebra.
  Carve a `Submodule` (carrier + three closure proofs) rather than a `structure` +
  `Module` instance. Diagonalize a matrix problem so the ODE reduces to the scalar
  lemma. A draft that instead *asserts* the side-condition as a new hypothesis is
  the wrong shape.
- **Casts go outward around lattice/arith ops** to match library normal form:
  `↑(min p t)`, not `min ↑p ↑t` — a coe-inward statement fails to unify downstream,
  and a co-occurring "stuck metavariable" is a *symptom* of the cast mismatch, not a
  separate problem. Fix the cast, not the instance.
- **Name derived measures/σ-algebras** (`trimMeasure_T`, a predictable σ-algebra) as
  defs; never inline `(P.trim …)` in a statement — the inlined form carries a
  σ-algebra-instance mismatch the named def avoids.
- **State Lp-class facts in `=ᵐ`/`condExp` form, not pointwise.** For a process whose
  value is an Lp class, honest pointwise `Adapted` is awkward; the conditional-
  expectation identity is the real content and it elaborates.
- **State shared hypotheses in the eta-form the consumers want** (`fun ω ↦ B t ω - B s
  ω`, not Pi-`sub`), so a defeq `exact` propagates instead of a rewrite failing.
- **Don't quantify integrals over `↥Submodule`** — instance synthesis (`BorelSpace
  ↥K`) fails; stay in the ambient space with subset/membership hypotheses.
- **Natural generality** (already in the drafter contract, restated here): `s.Nonempty`
  over a member-witness; `A ≠ 0` over provable positivity; the minimal typeclass the
  callees need.
- **Check the sign on a scale-invariance / homogeneity claim** (2026-07-19). `f (c • x)
  = |c| · f x` (or `= c · f x`) for ALL real `c` is usually FALSE for `c < 0` when `f`
  is a sup/inf over an asymmetric set — a drawdown, a range, any one-sided extremum: a
  negative scalar flips the extremum. Default the quantifier to `0 ≤ c` (or `c > 0`)
  unless the sign genuinely does not matter, and match the sign convention the issue's
  sibling clauses already use. #73 `maxDD`: the issue's `∀ c` form is false — `P =
  ![0, 1]` gives `maxDD (-P) = 1 ≠ 0 = |-1| · maxDD P`; the true claim is `0 ≤ c`.
- **Do NOT guard a division unless the conclusion actually breaks at zero** (2026-07-31).
  In Lean `x / 0 = 0`, so a quotient statement is usually *already* true in the
  degenerate case and a `denominator ≠ 0` hypothesis is dead weight — it makes the
  theorem strictly weaker for nothing. `div_nonneg` needs only `0 ≤` on both legs, and
  `mul_div_assoc` (`a * b / c = a * (b / c)`) has no side condition at all. The reflex
  is imported from ordinary mathematics, where `x/0` is undefined; it fired on 4/4
  autoform drafts of #161/#162 (`0 < ∑ r⁻` on gain-to-pain nonnegativity, `∑ b ≠ 0` on
  upside-capture homogeneity) and no gate caught it, because a weaker theorem
  type-checks exactly as happily as a strong one. **Test before asserting a guard:
  delete it and see if the proof still closes.** Do keep the hypothesis where it is
  genuinely load-bearing — `one_le_gainToPain_iff` needs `0 < ∑ r⁻`, because that is
  what makes the quotient comparable to `1` (`one_le_div`), and `fraValue`'s `δ ≠ 0`
  and `P₂ ≠ 0` both fail concretely at zero.

## Repair table (compiler error → fix) (2026-07-18)

The recurring error→fix mappings from the grind history. Try the mapped fix before
a general search; most are one-line and defeq-driven.

| Error signature | Fix |
|---|---|
| "did not find an occurrence" / "made no progress" with `(fun … ↦ …) x` or a Pi-`+`/`-`/`*` of lambdas in the goal | `show` the beta-reduced goal / `simp only []`; or type-annotate the `have` with the single-lambda form. Diagnose a stuck `convert` with `exact h`. |
| `convert` on a `HasDerivAt` leaves a goal between two **instances** (`instAddCommGroup = normedCommRing.toAddCommGroup`) | The combinator (`HasDerivAt.mul`/`.div`) returned a Pi-`*`/`/` of functions, so `convert … using 1` descended into the instance argument. Bind the result to a `have` whose **expected type spells the goal's lambda**, and let the combinator elaborate into it — then `convert` has only the value goal left.

| A `√τ` that will not cancel after `field_simp` | Rewrite the goal's denominator into the squared form rather than chasing `Real.sq_sqrt` through the result: `rw [show S ^ 2 * σ ^ 2 * τ = (S * σ * √τ) ^ 2 from by rw [mul_pow, mul_pow, Real.sq_sqrt hτ.le]]`, then `field_simp; ring`. Same move as `bs_identity`'s `σ ^ 2 * τ = (σ * √τ) ^ 2`. |

Contrast `measurable_iff_comap_le`, whose measurable-space arguments are plain implicits and unify correctly on their own. |

## Martingale-representation infrastructure (2026-08-06 batch)

Patterns from the martingale-representation program's first four tasks
(`docs/plans/2026-08-04-martingale-representation.md`): locality and totality results for the Itô
integral, and the orthogonality argument that identifies the representation.

### `𝓕_a`-linearity of a stochastic integral, by simple-process density

The shape: build the two sides as continuous linear maps and equalize them on the dense range of
simple-process assemblies via `DenseRange.equalizer`, exactly as `Foundations/ItoIntegralProcessGeneral.lean`'s
`itoProcessCLM_eq_condExpL2` (:134, the `DenseRange.equalizer` call at :144) and
`itoProcessCLM_terminal_eq` (:213, at :216) already do. Both are worth reading as templates before
writing a third instance of this technique.

The wrinkle that made it non-obvious (`Foundations/ItoIntegralLocality.lean`, Task 2): multiplying an
Itô integrand by a merely `𝓕_a`-measurable `Z` is *not* predictable. Predictability of
`(t,ω) ↦ Z ω` would need `Z` to be `𝓕_0`-measurable, and the trim measure `trim_T` charges the whole
band `(0,a]`, not just `{0}`, so no a.e.-equal predictable representative exists either. The statement
is false, not just hard. The repair multiplies by `afterFactor a Z (t,ω) = 𝟙_{a<t}·Z ω` instead, which
*is* predictable (`Ioi a ×ˢ F` for `F ∈ 𝓕_a` is a generating predictable rectangle) and stays a total
CLM on the whole of `Lp ℝ 2 (trimMeasure_T …)`. Totality matters mechanically: `DenseRange.equalizer`
equalizes on the whole space, so the operator can't be defined only on a supported-after-`a` subspace —
the support hypothesis has to live on the *characterizing* lemma (`coeFn_smulAdapted`, which takes
`hφ : ∀ᵐ p, p.1 ≤ a → φ p = 0` and is then invisible against the naive `Z p.2 * φ p`) rather than on
the definition. The unconditional a.e. form is `coeFn_smulAdapted_afterFactor`.

Extracted along the way: `mulBddCLM` — multiplication by a bounded measurable function as a CLM on
`Lp ℝ 2 ν`, for an arbitrary measure and σ-algebra. Mathlib has no such operator; both scalings in
`ItoIntegralLocality.lean` are instances of it.

### An unbounded multiplier, without truncation machinery

The obvious route to extend the bounded-`Z` result to unbounded `Z` is `clampM` plus dominated
convergence. `itoIntegralCLM_T_smulAdapted_of_memLp` (`Foundations/ItoIntegralLocality.lean`) doesn't
do that: for each `M : ℕ`, let `A = {|Z| ≤ M} ∈ 𝓕_a` and apply the *bounded* theorem twice — once
factoring `𝟙_A` (bound `1`) against the sample-side integrand, once factoring `𝟙_A · Z` (bound `M`)
against the trim-side one. The two scaled results coincide a.e. (both reduce to `𝟙_{a<t}·𝟙_A·Z·φ`), so
the claim holds on `A`; `ae_all_iff` + `exists_nat_ge` glue the countable family of `A`'s to the whole
space. About 40 lines against a full truncation analysis, and no dominated-convergence argument
anywhere.

### Orthogonality to a vanishing conditional expectation, via MGF comparison

`Foundations/WienerExponentialTotality.lean` (Task 4) proves an `F ∈ L²(𝓕ᴮ_T)` orthogonal to every
step-Doléans exponential is `0`. Split `F = F⁺ − F⁻`, push both parts forward by
`ν± = μ.withDensity (ENNReal.ofReal ∘ (±f))` into two *finite* measures on `ι → ℝ`. The domain where
the complex MGF argument is licensed, `integrableExpSet`, is the whole space: `F ∈ L²` against an
`exp⟨λ,X⟩` that is also `L²` (Gaussian-tailed Brownian marginals) makes their product `L¹` for every
`λ`, by Cauchy–Schwarz — so the set is `univ`, hence open, and `eqOn_complexMGF_of_mgf'` extends the
equality everywhere. Because `ν±` are finite rather than probability measures, this is the *primed*
lemma, which additionally wants `ν⁺(Ω) = ν⁻(Ω)`, i.e. that `F` is centered — itself read off the
orthogonality hypothesis at one instantiation (see the used-vs-needed note below). Finish with
Cramér–Wold done properly for a vector index: not `Measure.ext_of_complexMGF_eq` (one-dimensional), but
`charFunDual (ν.map X) L = complexMGF ⟨λ,X⟩ ν i` for `λᵢ = L(eᵢ)`, so MGF equality at every `λ` is
exactly the hypothesis of `Measure.ext_of_charFunDual` on the plain product `ι → ℝ` — cheaper than
routing through `EuclideanSpace ℝ ι`, which needs a `MeasurableEquiv` detour around `WithLp`.

Record the distinction that made a shared root with `ExpMartingaleQBrownian.lean` the wrong move, even
though both files import `ComplexMGF`. That file's three internal call sites compare a genuine
*probability* measure against `gaussianReal` on `ℝ`, using the *unprimed* `eqOn_complexMGF_of_mgf` and
the one-dimensional `ext_of_complexMGF_eq` (a real, pre-existing triplication, worth a standalone
cleanup: the statement `map_eq_gaussianReal_of_mgf_eq` is ready to paste). `WienerExponentialTotality`
compares two finite Jordan pieces on `ℝ^ι` and needs `charFunDual` for the vector finish; its
`integrableExpSet = univ` comes from Cauchy–Schwarz, not a Gaussian-law transfer. The literal overlap
between the two is one line: `interior univ = univ`, so the `EqOn` holds everywhere. A root lemma for
one line would be a bare Mathlib wrapper, which this repo's anti-wrapper stance forbids. Different
setting, no extraction.

### Countable generation of a natural filtration, from path continuity

`Foundations/BrownianCylinderGeneration.lean` (Task 1) proves
`⨆ₙ cylinderSigma B T n = natFiltration hBmeas T`, where
`cylinderSigma B T n = ⨆ q ∈ dyadicGrid T n, comap (B q) inferInstance` is the σ-algebra generated by
the level-`n` dyadic grid. Path continuity is used exactly once: given `s ≤ T`, the nearest dyadic grid
points `qₙ → s` (`tendsto_nat_floor_mul_div_atTop`, read along `x = 2ⁿ`), and continuity turns that
into `B qₙ → B s` pointwise, which `measurable_of_tendsto_metrizable` upgrades to measurability of
`B s` against the supremum σ-algebra. Every other inclusion is pure `iSup` bookkeeping. The result has
to be bundled as a genuine `cylinderFiltration : Filtration ℕ mΩ` (monotone, `≤` the ambient space),
not left as a bare fact about a supremum of σ-algebras. Task 4's use of it (closing `F =ᵐ 0` via Lévy's
upward martingale-convergence theorem, `Integrable.tendsto_eLpNorm_condExp`) needs the `Filtration`
structure to feed that lemma, which is exactly why it reaches for
`iSup_cylinderFiltration_eq_natFiltration` rather than the plain σ-algebra version.

### Verification discipline: daemon `autoImplicit`, and the `lake lint` unused-argument gate

Two disciplines paid for themselves repeatedly across this program's four tasks. First: the daemon
elaborates with `autoImplicit true`, `lake build` with `false`, so a file that lean-checks clean is not
yet known to build. Every task re-verified once under a temporary `set_option autoImplicit false`
before calling itself done — one extra round trip, and it is the only way to rule out a class of bug
the daemon alone can't see (Task 2's report is the first to name it explicitly; Tasks 3 and 4 both
adopted it unprompted).

Second: `lake lint` is a CI gate `lake build` does not run, and its `unusedArguments` check turns an
unused hypothesis kept for signature fidelity into a build-failing error, not a warning.
`Foundations/DoleansStepRepresentation.lean`'s `stepDoleans_sub_one_mem_range` kept `hs0 : s 0 = 0`
because the specified signature carried it (the hypothesis was later dropped outright — see the
used-vs-needed entry below — but the lint lesson stands), and the daemon reported only a plain
`linter.unusedVariables` warning, which `lake lint` then failed the build on. The repair that preserves
the public interface is renaming to `_hs0` (arity, type, and argument position all unchanged, so no
call site moves), the same move Task 4 later applied to `_hF1`. Recorded lesson: a
`linter.unusedVariables` warning from the daemon predicts a `lake lint` error, so treat it as red at
authoring time, not as noise to clear later.

### A `sorry`-typecheck verifies elaboration, not intent

`Foundations/WienerExponentialTotality.lean`'s `eq_zero_of_orthogonal_stepDoleans` and
`integral_mul_exp_linear_eq_zero` were both drafted under a `variable` block carrying
`(hB : IsPreBrownianReal B μ)`, but neither statement's body mentioned `hB`. Lean only
auto-includes an explicit `variable` binder a statement names, so both theorems shipped without
it, and both were false as stated: a time-constant but random `B t ω = Z ω` is continuous,
measurable, and satisfies every remaining hypothesis, while giving a nonzero `F` (`F = Z`,
`𝓕_T`-measurable since `𝓕_T = σ(Z)`, centered, in `L²`, orthogonal to the whole Doléans family).
The lazy counterexample `B ≡ 0` does not work: it collapses `𝓕_T` to `⊥` (`comap_const`,
`iSup_bot`) and forces `F = 0` for the wrong reason, a measurability collapse rather than
Brownianness. A `sorry`-stubbed signature check cannot tell these apart. It proves the false,
weaker statement exactly as happily as the true one.

The detection rule that actually catches it: a scratch-file signature is suspect when it (a) omits
a `variable`-block hypothesis it never names, and (b) is a claim about a *specific* process rather
than an arbitrary one. An audit of the remaining scratch statements against that rule found
exactly one more defect: `itoIsometryEquiv_T` (shipped as `itoIsometryEquiv` — an
underscore in a `def` name is a `lake lint` error; the terminal-integral isometry `φ ↦ ∫₀ᵀ φ dB`,
which plainly does not exist without a Brownian motion to integrate against). Everything else was
clean because it happened to mention `itoIntegralCLM_T hB` or similar and picked the variable up
that way.

### Its twin: an isolation probe can only falsify

The same program's cleanup pass produced the other half of that lesson, and the two belong together.
Priority D changed `obtain ⟨ψ, hψ⟩ := id hy` to `obtain ⟨ψ, hψ⟩ := hy` in
`Foundations/MartingaleRepresentation.lean`, reading the `id` as a redundant defeq nudge. It is not.
`id` is the idiom for destructuring *without clearing*: a bare `obtain … := hy` consumes `hy` and
removes it from context, while `id hy` destructures a copy and leaves the original alive. `hy` is used
again a few lines down (`exact hy`), so the file stopped compiling with `Unknown identifier hy`. Both
the implementer and the reviewer had read the edit as cosmetic.

What makes it worth recording is how it was checked. The pass *did* probe the edit in isolation, and saw
green. The probe asserted the wrong property: it checked that `obtain ⟨ψ, hψ⟩ := hy` **elaborates**,
which it does, cleanly, and that green was read as licensing the edit. The property at risk was
hypothesis **lifetime**, which surfaces only when something later uses `hy`. An isolation probe
reproduces the code but not its context, so it can falsify a local claim and never confirm one that
depends on the surroundings.

This and the `sorry`-typecheck entry above are one genus: **a green check answering a different question
than the one asked.** The typecheck answers "does this signature elaborate?" when the question was "does
it say what I meant?". The isolation probe answers "does this line elaborate?" when the question was
"does the file still work with this line changed?". In both cases the fix is to pick a check whose scope
matches the claim: the whole-file `lake build` gate for an edit inside a proof, drop-and-reprove for a
hypothesis (next entry). The `id hy` now carries a comment saying why, since two independent agents
misread it unannotated.

### The used-vs-needed guard, once more

The 2026-07-31 entry above (under "Statement design") already covers a hypothesis that is unnecessary
from the moment it's drafted — a division guard nothing downstream needs. This program produced a
different-shaped instance of the same failure mode, worth recording rather than folding silently into
the same bullet: a hypothesis a proof *consumes* can still be unnecessary to the *theorem*, discovered
only after the fact. `eq_zero_of_orthogonal_stepDoleans` (`Foundations/WienerExponentialTotality.lean`)
carried a centering hypothesis `hF1 : ∫ F ∂μ = 0` in its public signature, as specified. The
orthogonality hypothesis `hFperp` already implies it at one instantiation (`h ≡ 0, N = 1`: the
step-Doléans exponential of the zero integrand is identically `1`, independent of `B`, so `hFperp`
there says exactly `∫F = 0`). `hF1` was redundant from the start. Underscoring it (`_hF1`) satisfied
the lint gate without exposing the redundancy, because the theorem type-checks identically either way;
only dropping the hypothesis and re-deriving centering internally (from `hFperp` at that one
instantiation) surfaced that it was never needed. The signature change itself needed a human-partner
call, since it strengthened a spec-mandated theorem. The discovery, though, came from drop-and-reprove,
not from any gate.

### Never name a measure `R`

A measure bound to `R` breaks integral notation: `∫ ω, f ω ∂R` elaborates as `∫ ω, (f ω ∂R)` against
`volume`, so the error lands on the integrand and says nothing about the name. Rename to `ν`. Cost of
rediscovering it in `Foundations/MarketCompleteness.lean` was one confusing round trip, and there is no
diagnostic that points at the cause.

### Daemon overruns track import-set switches, not file size

A 26-line scratch file overran the daemon's elaboration cap in the same session in which a 126-line one
passed. Size was not the variable. The 126-line file's imports were already resident from the preceding
check, while the 26-line one switched import sets and paid the load. Sequencing checks so consecutive
ones share an import set is worth roughly 3×.

That reframes the standing "keep authored files small" advice: what costs time is import churn between
consecutive checks, not the number of declarations in the file under test. When a session has to touch
several modules, order the checks by import closure rather than by the order the edits happened.

## Naming an `L²` limit, and the wrapper that hid one (2026-08-07 batch)

From [#183](https://github.com/formal-applied-math/formal-mathfin/issues/183): carrying the identification
`gfx =ᵐ [the integrand]` through the localized Itô chain.

### Identify an `L²` limit by *pointwise* limits of a.e. representatives

The general fact (`ae_eq_of_tendsto_Lp_of_tendsto`, `Foundations/ItoFormulaLocalized.lean`): if
`gₙ → g` in `L²` and each `gₙ` is a.e. equal to a concrete `hₙ` with `hₙ x → h x` for every `x`, then
`g =ᵐ h`. Three lines of Mathlib — `tendstoInMeasure_of_tendsto_Lp` for the `Lp`-to-in-measure step,
`TendstoInMeasure.exists_seq_tendsto_ae` for the subsequence, `tendsto_nhds_unique` to finish, with
`ae_all_iff` folding the countably many a.e. equalities into one.

Two things make this the cheap route, and both are easy to miss.

**The subsequence is enough.** `L²` convergence gives a.e. convergence only along a subsequence, which
reads like a weakness. It is not: a subsequence of a convergent sequence has the same limit, and limits
in `ℝ` are unique, so the identification is settled.

**`h ∈ L²` is a conclusion, not a hypothesis.** The obvious alternative — show `hₙ → h` in `L²` and use
uniqueness of `Lp` limits — needs `h ∈ L²` up front, which for the localized Itô formula means proving
`f_x(·, B_·) ∈ L²(trim)` by domination. The a.e. route asks nothing of `h`; membership falls out
afterwards from `g ∈ L²` and `g =ᵐ h`. When a limit statement seems to need an integrability
prerequisite, check whether the a.e. formulation gets it for free.

At the call site the pointwise hypothesis was not an analysis argument at all. Each cutoff's chain-rule
integrand `f_x(·, φₙ(B))·φₙ'(B)` is *eventually constant* in `n` at every point: once `n ≥ |B|`,
`cut_eq_id_of_abs_le` and `cutD1_eq_one_of_abs_lt` make the truncation inert. So the whole limit is
`tendsto_const_nhds.congr'` against an `eventually_ge_atTop ⌈|·|⌉₊` filter — no domination, no measure
theory. A localizing family that is eventually inert pointwise is usually identifiable this way.

### A trim measure erases a time cutoff

`ae_fst_mem_Ioc_trimMeasure_T` (`Foundations/ItoIntegralCLM.lean`): trim-a.e. `z`, `z.1 ∈ Ioc 0 T`, the
pointwise reading of `trimMeasure_T_eq_restrict`. That is what lets `ito_formula_itoProcess` state its
integrand as `σ·f'(X₀ + b·z.1 + σ·B)` although the localized formula hands back
`σ·f'(X₀ + b·φₙ(z.1) + σ·B)`: past the horizon the trim charges nothing, and inside it `φₙ = id`. The
same erasure applies to any time-localized construction whose statement lives on the trim.

### The forgetful wrapper is a defect generator

`ito_formula_td_L2_bddDeriv_explicit` had carried the naming conjunct since it was written.
`ito_formula_td_L2_bddDeriv` was a wrapper whose only job was to drop it, kept for "consumers that only
need the integrated identity". Every consumer then used the short name, the conjunct was never
propagated, and #183 is the result: a four-theorem chain of bare existentials sitting directly on top
of a theorem that already knew the answer.

The tell is in the docstring. A wrapper justified as "drops X, retained for consumers that only need Y"
is not a convenience — it is a fork in the API where the weaker branch has the better name, and the
weaker branch wins. Prefer one theorem stating the strongest true thing; consumers project with `.2` or
discard with `⟨g, -, h⟩`. This is the anti-wrapper rule (`feedback_avoid_wrapper_lemmas`) applied to
our *own* lemmas rather than to Mathlib's, and it is where that rule actually earns its keep.

Corollary worth checking during any values review: **where prose outruns the statement.** All five
corpus entries touched here described the stochastic term as `∫₀ᵀ f_x(s,B_s) dB_s` or `∫₀ᵀ σŜ(s) dB_s`
in their `description` and docstring while stating only `∃ gfx`. Nobody wrote a false claim
deliberately; the prose described the theorem everyone had in mind, and the statement quietly said
less. Reading a docstring against its own statement is a cheap, high-yield audit.

### Two mechanical traps met on the way

**A `refine` hole under a lambda cannot see the binder.** `refine ⟨w, lemma h₁ h₂ fun z ↦ tac ?_, ?_⟩`
elaborates, but the resulting goal does *not* have `z` in context — the metavariable is created outside
the lambda — so the next tactic fails with `Unknown identifier 'z'`. Put the hole directly under the
binder and continue in tactic mode: `refine lemma h₁ h₂ fun z ↦ ?_` then work on the goal.

**`[MeasurableSpace α]` blocks unification with a non-canonical σ-algebra.** A helper stated with an
instance-implicit `[MeasurableSpace α]` will have `Prod.instMeasurableSpace` synthesized for
`α = ℝ≥0 × Ω`, which is not the predictable σ-algebra the trim measure carries — the error is
"synthesized type class instance is not definitionally equal to expression inferred by typing rules".
Use a plain implicit `{mα : MeasurableSpace α}`, determined by the measure argument. Mathlib's own
measure-theory lemmas (`tendstoInMeasure_of_tendsto_Lp` among them) declare it exactly this way, and
that is why they compose with our trims at all.

### Grep the statement before writing the lemma

`ae_fst_mem_Ioc_trimMeasure_T` — "trim-a.e. `z`, `z.1 ∈ Ioc 0 T`" — existed **six** times when the
2026-08-07 audit looked: a `private lemma` in `ItoIntegralLocality`, four inline `have`s
(`ItoIntegralRiemannBridge`, `…TD`, `…Adapted`, `SimpleProcessPartition`), and the public one added the
day before in `ItoIntegralCLM` by someone who did not check. Five are now retired.

The lesson is not "avoid duplication", which everyone already believes. It is that **the duplicate is
invisible from the site where you create it.** You are writing a `have` inside a proof, it is two lines,
and naming it would be ceremony. That judgment is right locally and wrong five times over. Before
adding any general-looking `have` or lemma, grep for its *conclusion* — not its name, which does not
exist yet:

```bash
grep -rn "z.1 ∈ Set.Ioc 0 T" MathFin --include='*.lean'
```

The previous values review's headline was the same failure in a different shape (three general lemmas
stranded in application files), and recording that lesson did not stop this one, because nothing
searches. That is why "a duplicate-statement detector" is the top backlog item rather than another
note.

### Negative-control every gate you write

The prose-vs-statement gate's first draft passed the whole corpus, including `sc-thm-7.1.1` — the entry
it was written to catch. It tested for *any* `=ᵐ` after the `∃`, and `sc-thm-7.1.1`'s main identity is
itself an `=ᵐ`, so the check confirmed a property that was always true instead of the one at risk.

So: before trusting a new gate, **reintroduce the defect and watch it fail.** Copy the corpus to a
scratch directory, revert the fix, run the gate, confirm it names exactly the reverted entries, delete
the copy. It costs a minute. A gate that cannot fail on its own motivating example is worse than no
gate, because everything downstream now reads as checked.

Same genus as the `sorry`-typecheck and isolation-probe traps recorded in the 2026-08-06 batch: a
cheap check silently redefines success. Third instance in two sessions, this time in a gate we wrote
ourselves rather than one we inherited.


## Weighted `L²`, and integrating against an Itô integral (2026-08-16 batch)

From the chain-rule phase (`ItoIntegralAgainstMartingale`, `LpMulIsometry`,
`PredictableDensityGeneral`, `PricingMeasureL2Density`).

### Build the integral against `M` by transport, not by a second `extendOfNorm`

The integrands square-integrable against `M = φ●B` live on the bracket-weighted `L²(φ²·ν)`, and
`ψ ↦ ψφ` is an isometry from there into `L²(ν)`. So `∫· dM := itoIntegralCLM_T ∘ (mulLI φ)` has the
right domain *and* the right isometry with no new analysis. The from-scratch alternative needs the
conditional bracket identity `𝔼[(M_t − M_s)² | 𝓕_s] = 𝔼[⟨M⟩_t − ⟨M⟩_s | 𝓕_s]`, which the tower does
not have. **The transport proves what the from-scratch construction would have assumed.**

The price of transport is that the definition alone proves nothing, so the elementary identity
(`∫ Z·1_{(a,b]} dM = Z·(M_b − M_a)`) is not decoration — it is the theorem that makes the name honest.
State it, and say in the docstring what it does *not* cover.

### Weighted `L²` classes are coarser: every linearity proof ends in a case split

`Lp ℝ 2 (f²·ν)` is classes modulo `(f²·ν)`-null sets, which is coarser than modulo `ν`-null: `{f = 0}`
is `(f²·ν)`-null and generally not `ν`-null. So two representatives of one class can disagree on a
`ν`-non-null set, and `ψ ↦ fψ` is still well defined because both products vanish where `f = 0`.
Mathlib's `withDensitySMulLI` (the `p = 1` case) does exactly this, and the tool is
`ae_withDensity_iff`, which converts `∀ᵐ x ∂(ν.withDensity g), P x` into `∀ᵐ x ∂ν, g x ≠ 0 → P x`.
Every `filter_upwards` in `mulLM` ends `rcases eq_or_ne (f x) 0`.

When `f ≠ 0` a.e. the two measures are *equivalent* and the implication runs both ways
(`ae_of_sqWeight_of_ae_ne_zero`) — which is what lets a hypothesis stated for the weighted measure be
used against `ν`, and it is easy to reach for the wrong direction.

### Weaken a hypothesis instead of porting the proof

The weighted density theorem looked like a 150-line port of a π-λ induction to a second measure. It
was not needed: the induction's core only ever used that its argument is **integrable**, so the
weight moves into the integrand as `h := f²·g`, and orthogonality to every simple process says
`∫_R h = 0` on every rectangle. `h` is `L¹` and generally not `L²` — which is precisely why the core
had to be restated from an `L²` class to an integrable function. **Before porting a long argument to
a new setting, check what its hypotheses are actually used for.**

### A `dite` makes a summand total when the hypotheses live on the support

To decompose a simple process into its bands *inside* `Lp`, the summand needs `p.1 ≤ p.2`, the
`𝓕_{p.1}`-measurability and the bound on `V.value p` — all available only for `p ∈ support`, which
would make the summand dependent on membership and the `Finset` sum painful. Define it as

```lean
if h : MemLp (elemIntegrand p.1 p.2 (V.val.value p)) 2 ν then h.toLp _ else 0
```

which is total, prove `coeFn_bandLp` under the membership hypothesis, and the sum is an ordinary
`Finset.sum` over a non-dependent function. Off the support the band is `0` anyway, so nothing is
lost. `MeasureTheory.Lp.coeFn_fun_finsetSum` is the coeFn lemma for such a sum (note: `Lp.coeFn_sum`
is the *sequence* space `lp`, a different object).

### `rw` does not unfold a `def`, and does not see through a beta-redex

Two failures that cost several iterations each, both with the same symptom (`Did not find an
occurrence of the pattern`):

* the goal mentions `bandRestrict …` and the hypothesis is about its unfolding — `rw` will not unfold
  a `def`; use `simp only [bandRestrict]` or a `show`;
* the goal is `(fun x => …) ω = …` after `filter_upwards` or inside `∃!` — `rw` matches syntactically
  and the redex is not reduced; `simp only [lemma]` beta-reduces first and works.

### Instance search does not unfold a `def` either

`bracketMeasure T hBmeas φ` is `sqWeight (trimMeasure_T …) ⇑φ` by `rfl`, and an
`IsFiniteMeasure (sqWeight …)` instance is *not* found for the `bracketMeasure` form. Supply it with a
local `haveI` at the one call site rather than duplicating the instance. Relatedly, pin the σ-algebra
by giving the `def` an explicit return type: `sqWeight` applied to a trimmed measure will otherwise
resolve its `MeasurableSpace` by instance search to `Prod.instMeasurableSpace` and mismatch — the same
trap `trimMeasure_T`'s own docstring warns about.

### De-privatising is a free audit

`increment_integrable` was `private`, so `lake lint` never checked it. Making it public revealed that
it never used its `IsProbabilityMeasure` hypothesis — nor even `IsFiniteMeasure`. The binder is gone.
If a private lemma is worth exposing, expect the linter to find something.


## The `Lp`-process adaptedness trap, and lifting to the widest measure (2026-08-16, second batch)

From the coherence pass over the chain-rule tower.

### An `Lp`-valued process is *not* adapted, and `Martingale` will not tell you

`Lp.stronglyMeasurable f` produces a representative measurable for the **ambient** σ-algebra. For a
filtration it gives only `AEStronglyMeasurable[𝓕 t]` — which is what the `L²` theory needs and is
strictly weaker than `Adapted`, which `Martingale` requires pointwise. So

```lean
Martingale (fun t ω ↦ S₀ + (itoProcessCLM hB T t hBmeas σ : Ω → ℝ) ω) 𝓕 Q
```

is a hypothesis with **no known witness**, and every theorem assuming it typechecks, passes the axiom
audit, and may be vacuous. Nothing in the toolchain flags this: it is a true theorem about an empty
situation.

Two fixes, both cheap:

* **Rebuild the process from `μ[· | 𝓕 t]`.** Conditional expectation is `𝓕 t`-strongly measurable by
  construction (`stronglyMeasurable_condExp`), and `(φ●B)_t` is a.e. equal to it — for us that is
  `itoProcessCLM_eq_condExpL2`, an identity the tower was already built on. `martingale_condExp` then
  hands over the martingale property.
* **State the theorem over an abstract adapted `S`** plus `∀ t ≤ T, S t =ᵐ[μ] price t`. This is what
  `ContinuousMarket.IsEMM` already does, for exactly this reason; instantiating it with an `Lp`
  coercion is the regression to watch for.

Ship both: the abstract statement, and a `∃ S, Martingale S 𝓕 μ ∧ …` witness beside it. The repo's
older `pricesGainsAtZero_self` is the same instinct — **a hypothesis with no exhibited witness is a
finding, not a style point.**

### Lift a lemma to the widest measure it is true for, not the one that needed it

`uncurry_ae_eq_sum_rectTerm` was stated for `timeMeasure.prod μ`, with the null-set fact inlined in the
proof. Reading it, the *only* thing used is that the measure charges the time origin nothing — not
finiteness, not the product structure, not even which σ-algebra it lives on. Generalising to

```lean
{m : MeasurableSpace (ℝ≥0 × Ω)} {ν : @Measure (ℝ≥0 × Ω) m} (hν : ∀ᵐ z ∂ν, z.1 ≠ 0)
```

made the bracket-weighted predictable measure a second consumer and deleted a copy of the proof that
had been written against it. **Generalising over the `MeasurableSpace` too is the part that is easy to
miss** — a trimmed measure has a different type, so a lemma implicitly fixed to `Prod.instMeasurableSpace`
cannot be reused however weak its measure hypotheses are.

The tell that this was owed: two proofs sharing four load-bearing lines verbatim
(`SimpleProcess.apply_eq` → `Set.indicator_of_notMem` → `zero_add` → `Finsupp.sum`).

### Same function, two names: dedupe toward the *smaller* signature

`ItoIntegralL2.rectTerm hBmeas V p` and `elemIntegrand p.1 p.2 (V.value p)` were the same function.
The dedupe direction is not "whichever came first" — it is toward the definition with fewer
irrelevant parameters. `elemIntegrand` mentions neither the driver nor the filtration, so it became
the primitive and `rectTerm` its instance, `rfl`-equal so the two can never drift. Downstream cost was
three `rw [rectTerm]` sites that needed `elemIntegrand` added to the unfolding.


### The slot watcher that watched the wrong noun (2026-08-16)

Waiting for the shared Lean slot, I armed

```bash
until ! docker ps --format '{{.Names}}' | grep -q '^docker-lean-repl-1$'; do sleep 20; done
```

It fired, correctly: the daemon container was gone. The slot was **not** free. The other session
had taken the daemon down in order to run its authoritative `lake build MathFin` in a one-shot
`verify` container — a differently-named container running a differently-named process, holding
the same 4-5 GB. Acting on that signal would have put two Mathlib-loaded Lean processes on a
10 GB box, which is every OOM this repo has ever had.

The watcher tracked **the daemon**, and the property at risk is **any Lean-loaded process**. Those
coincide right up until the moment they matter — the handoff. The condition to wait on is the
property, not the artifact that usually carries it:

```bash
until [ -z "$(docker ps --format '{{.Image}}' | grep -i mathfin-verify)" ] \
   && [ -z "$(ps -eo comm | grep -x lake)" ]; do sleep 20; done
```

Same shape as the `grep -c` and `sorry`-typecheck traps in earlier batches, and the third time the
lesson has arrived as *a check that passes while the thing it stands for is false*.

**The corrected watcher then fired too, and was also wrong.** It caught the nine-second gap between
the peer's `lake build` container exiting and its daemon coming back up — a gap *between two of
their steps*, not a handoff. Which is the real lesson, one level down:

> **No instantaneous poll of an unowned resource can tell you the resource is yours.** "Nobody is
> using it right now" and "it has been handed to me" are different propositions, and only the
> second one is safe to act on. Every poll of the first races the owner's next step, and here each
> false positive invites starting a 4-5 GB process on a box with room for one.

Polling was not merely unreliable, it was actively hazardous: a watcher that fires wrongly is worse
than no watcher, because it manufactures a moment of apparent permission. The sound protocol is
mutual exclusion by **explicit transfer** — the other session pings when it has stopped and intends
to stay stopped. Use polls only to notice that a promised handoff has *not* arrived, never to
substitute for one.


### A background task's "exit code 0" is the WRAPPER's, not the command's (2026-08-16)

A `ledger verify` sweep failed two entries. The task-completion notification said
`completed (exit code 0)`, and I wrote that down as "`ledger verify` exits 0 while reporting
failures" — and nearly filed it as a bug.

It is false. `ledger.py:345` ends `return 1 if failures else 0`, and my own log's first line was
`LEDGER_VERIFY_EXIT=1`. The command exited **1**, correctly. The `0` was the background wrapper's
status.

This is already in the repo's memory from the SDE phase — *"bg-build notification exit = the
wrapper's; grep REAL_BUILD_EXIT"* — which is why the build commands here echo `REAL_BUILD_EXIT=$?`
into their own log. The lesson that did not transfer: **having written the echo, read it.** I
printed the true exit code into the file and then quoted the notification instead. Always take the
exit code from the line the command itself wrote.

### The real defect: an aborted sweep reports success (2026-08-16)

Chasing the above turned up a genuine bug in the same function. `ledger.py:310` handles a dead
checker with

```python
except (ConnectionRefusedError, OSError, subprocess.TimeoutExpired) as exc:
    print(f"\nABORT at {tid}: checker unavailable ({exc}). ...")
    break
```

which `break`s **without appending to `failures`**. Two consequences, since line 338 prints
`done: {len(targets) - len(failures)} verified`:

* every entry the loop never reached is counted as **verified**, because the count is inferred from
  `len(targets)` rather than from successes;
* `failures` can be empty, so the function returns **0**.

So a sweep that dies a third of the way through announces success with an inflated count. And the
trigger is precisely a REPL killed by `LEAN_ELAB_TIMEOUT` — the timeout and the false-success are
one bug, not two.

**`ledger status` is the only sound gate**, and the reason is not that verify's exit code lies: it
is that `status` recomputes freshness from input hashes, so it cannot be fooled by a loop that
never ran. Trust the recomputation, never the sweep's self-report.

### The 180s elaboration cap is a latent corpus flake, not a per-branch problem

Both failures above were `LEAN_ELAB_TIMEOUT`, not proofs. Re-running with

```bash
LEAN_ELAB_TIMEOUT=600 docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d lean-repl
```

cleared both, at **177.6s and 199.1s**. Note the first number: that entry passes the 180s default
by two seconds, so whether it fails depends on machine load, not on the branch. Any sweep that
restales the heavy Itô entries can fail on either.

`docker-compose.yml` already documents the override for "the rare heavy corpus entry"; the thing
worth adding is that **the rare entry is not reliably rare** — it is marginal. Prefer 600 for any
sweep that restales the Itô closure, and do not spend time diagnosing a timeout as a proof
regression: a `daemon error:` prefix means the REPL died, not that the theorem broke.

## The contracts tower — Lean authoring and environment traps (2026-08-17 batch)

Five patterns from building `MathFin/Contracts/` (the reified `Payoff`/`Contract` tower and its
reduction to Black–Scholes closed forms). The first two are ordinary Lean-authoring habit; the
last three are environment traps this box produced, and are worth more precisely because they
cost real wall-clock time and none of them announced themselves as errors.

### Statement-first probing is the Lean substitute for a failing test

`sorry` is banned in `MathFin/`, so there is no failing-test analogue of red-green-refactor —
except there is: write the theorem *statement* with a `sorry` body in a scratch file, `lean-check`
it, and read **zero errors at the expected `sorry_count`** as the passing RED signal (an elaborating
statement with an admittedly-missing proof), exactly the way a failing assertion is the passing
signal in TDD's red phase.

The trap this avoids: `tools/verify/lean_repl.py:91` computes

```python
"success": not error_msgs and sorry_count == 0,
```

so a stubbed statement can **never** report `success: true` — that field alone will always read as
failure while a `sorry` is in the file. The signal to read is `errors: []` at the sorry count you
expected, not `success`. Getting a statement to *elaborate* — the types, the implicit-argument
resolution, the right hypothesis bundle — is usually the hard part of a contracts-tower proof;
once it typechecks with a `sorry`, the proof itself is often short (`value_pay_eq` was one `simp`
call once its statement stopped fighting elaboration).

### Reify-then-reduce: `simp only` to the existing theorem's exact shape, then `exact`

Every `value_*` theorem in `BlackScholes.lean` and `CappedCall.lean` follows the same shape: unfold
the reified contract's semantics with a targeted `simp only [...]` list until the goal is
*syntactically* the integral an existing closed-form theorem already proves, then close with
`exact`/`rw` against that theorem — no new integral is ever touched. The one discipline that keeps
this from becoming eleven near-duplicate `simp only` lists is to extract the shared unfolding into
one lemma once a second call site needs it:

```lean
private theorem value_pay_eq {ι : Type*} (Q : Measure Ω) (D : ℝ≥0 → ℝ)
    (X : ι → ℝ≥0 → Ω → ℝ) (t : ℝ≥0) (a : Payoff ι) :
    (Contract.pay t a).value Q D X = ∫ ω, D t * a.eval (scenarioAt X ω) ∂Q := by
  simp [Contract.value, Contract.pathPV, Contract.cashflows]
```

`value_europeanCall`, `value_europeanPut` and `value_digitalCall` each then close with
`rw [<def>, value_pay_eq]` followed by the one line that invokes the target theorem. Two
guardrails make the pattern honest rather than a shortcut: never escalate the `simp only` list to a
bare `simp` (an unbounded simp set can accidentally discharge — or silently reshape — the very goal
the reduction is supposed to leave intact for the target theorem to close), and never edit the
target theorem to meet the reified goal halfway; the reification either reaches the library's
existing statement exactly, or the reduction lemma is wrong.

### A named volume masks the image's baked oleans — read past the pull

`docker compose pull verify` alone does **not** give a fresh container the image's prebuilt
`.lake` tree. `docker-compose.yml:149` documents why, right where the mount is declared:

```
# built (~10–15 min). The named volume is populated from the image's
# `/app/.lake/` on first creation (Docker semantics), then survives
```

`docker_lake_build_cache` is mounted at `/app/.lake` for **both** `verify` and `lean-repl`
(`Dockerfile.verify:33-38` is what bakes the oleans into the image in the first place: `COPY
MathFin/` then `lake exe cache get && lake build`). Docker only populates a named volume from the
image on the volume's *first* creation — an existing volume from a previous image hides whatever
the newly-pulled image baked. A pull that "did nothing" is not evidence the image is unchanged; it
is evidence the volume predates it.

### Rebasing onto a published commit is nearly free — measured

When a branch needs rebasing onto a `main` whose GHCR image CI has already published, the sequence
`daemon down → rebase → docker volume rm docker_lake_build_cache → daemon up` re-populates the
volume from the image's baked tree — a file **copy**, not a re-elaboration — and Lake then
elaborates only what the branch adds on top. **Measured 2026-08-17: 9 modules instead of ~9000,
about 59 seconds instead of the usual 10–15 minutes.**

Two preconditions, both easy to get wrong silently:

* the image must be built from the **exact commit** being rebased onto — check the
  `publish-verify-image` workflow run's `headSha`, not the image's OCI labels, which carry only the
  Ubuntu base version and say nothing about the Lean/Mathlib/MathFin content baked in;
* the branch must not modify any file the image's Dockerfile layer baked (`lakefile.lean`,
  `lean-toolchain`, `lake-manifest.json`, `MathFin.lean`, anything under `MathFin/` at that commit).

If either fails, the volume-drop buys nothing and Lake falls back to the ordinary rebuild it would
have paid anyway — the downside of trying is bounded at zero, which is why it is always worth
attempting before assuming a full rebuild is required.

### A long-running session's daemon silently changes image when it cycles

If `:latest` moves while a session is already running, the next `docker compose up -d lean-repl`
brings the daemon back on the **new** image with no signal that anything changed — no warning, no
version bump in the logs, nothing to grep for. Harmless when the toolchain and Mathlib pin are
unchanged across the two images. Not harmless otherwise: if the pull carried a toolchain or Mathlib
bump, the session is now elaborating proofs written for one Lean against a different one, mid-task,
and the first symptom reads as a proof failure — a tactic that "stopped working" — rather than as
what it actually is, an environment change underneath an unchanged file.

Guard: after any daemon restart in a session where `:latest` may have moved, diff the running
image's toolchain against the tree's —

```bash
docker run --rm --entrypoint cat <image> /app/lean-toolchain
```

— against `cat lean-toolchain`. One second, and it turns a silent mid-session environment change
into an immediate, legible mismatch.


## The conditional refinement is the unconditional one, localised (2026-08-27 batch)

### A conditional identity is a set-integral identity — localise, do not extend

Both sides of `μ[(M_b − M_a)² | 𝓕_a] = μ[∫_a^b φ² du | 𝓕_a]` are **quadratic** in the integrand,
so the reflex is: polarise into a bilinear form, prove it on generators, extend along a density.
That was the recorded design, and it was about 800 lines.

The reflex is wrong whenever the operator has an **`𝓕_a`-linearity lemma**. Unfold the conditional
expectation into what it is — agreement of `∫_F · dμ` over `F ∈ 𝓕_a` — and the indicator `𝟙_F`
becomes a *bounded `𝓕_a`-measurable factor*, exactly what such a lemma consumes:

```lean
-- 𝟙_F·(M_b − M_a) is not "a product"; it is again a single Itô integral
itoIntegralCLM_T_smulAdapted … : ⇑(J (smulAdapted T a hBmeas 𝟙_F … (bandRestrict T a b φ)))
                                   =ᵐ[μ] fun ω ↦ 𝟙_F ω * ⇑(J (bandRestrict T a b φ)) ω
```

and then `𝟙_F² = 𝟙_F` means the *square* costs nothing either: `∫_F (M_b − M_a)² dμ` is the
squared `L²`-norm of one integrand, which the isometry evaluates. About 200 lines, no density
argument, no ε — and the proof states the reason the theorem is true instead of grinding it out.

**The test for the pattern.** Does the library already prove `T(Z·φ) = Z·T(φ)` for bounded
`𝓕_a`-measurable `Z`? If yes, every unconditional statement about `‖T φ‖` has a conditional
refinement for free, and the density argument that built `T` never has to be re-run.

### Tonelli through a trim: keep each a.e. argument on its native side

`trimMeasure_T` is `(ρ ⊗ μ).trim` onto the predictable σ-algebra, and its `Lp` classes carry an
honest `StronglyMeasurable[predictable]` representative (`Lp.stronglyMeasurable`), so
`integral_trim` crosses to the product measure for free and `integral_prod` +
`integral_integral_swap` finish. That much is mechanical; the trap is ω-**sections**.

An a.e. equality of `Lp` representatives is a statement about the *trim* measure. It does not
directly give "for a.e. ω, for a.e. u", and manufacturing that costs a Fubini-on-null-sets detour.
Avoid needing it: write **one** explicit integrand and take *its* sections, which are computed
rather than a.e. —

```lean
private noncomputable def bandSq … : ℝ≥0 × Ω → ℝ :=
  (Set.Ioc a b ×ˢ F).indicator fun z ↦ ((φ : ℝ≥0 × Ω → ℝ) z) ^ 2
```

— and do every representative swap on the trim side. The two set-integral computations then meet
at a *rectangle integral*, `∫_{(a,b]×F} φ² d trim_T`, not at an ω-wise statement, and no lemma in
the file ever needs the sections of an `Lp` class.

### `Integrable.integral_prod_left` keeps the LEFT variable — and its `prod_*_ae` sibling reads the other way

Worth pinning, because guessing costs a full daemon round trip. For `f : α × β → E` and
`hf : Integrable f (μ.prod ν)`:

| lemma | conclusion | suffix names |
|---|---|---|
| `hf.integral_prod_left` | `Integrable (fun x ↦ ∫ y, f (x,y) ∂ν) μ` | the variable that **survives** |
| `hf.integral_prod_right` | `Integrable (fun y ↦ ∫ x, f (x,y) ∂μ) ν` | the variable that **survives** |
| `hf.prod_right_ae` | `∀ᵐ x ∂μ, Integrable (fun y ↦ f (x,y)) ν` | the variable **integrated over** |

So `integral_prod_*` and `prod_*_ae` name opposite things and cannot be read by one rule. To get
"for a.e. ω (the *right* variable), the section in `u` is integrable", the route is
`hf.swap.prod_right_ae`, with `Integrable.swap : Integrable f (μ.prod ν) → Integrable (f ∘ Prod.swap) (ν.prod μ)`.

### `bot_le` rewrites to `⊥`, not to `0`

In `ℝ≥0`, `max_eq_left bot_le` elaborates fine and then fails at the rewrite: its pattern is
`max ?a ⊥`, and the goal says `max a 0`. `⊥` and `0` are defeq here but they are different
constants, and `rw` matches syntactically. Pin the statement instead:

```lean
max_eq_left (show (0 : ℝ≥0) ≤ a from bot_le)
```

Same family: `Set.Ioc_disjoint_Ioc_consecutive` does not exist at this pin and
`integral_union` is now `setIntegral_union`. Both are two-second fixes that cost a round trip each
if batched with real errors — worth a `loogle`/`exact?` probe in the same pass that writes them.

### The daemon is memory-bound before it is time-bound

`docker/docker-compose.yml` caps `lean-repl` at `mem_limit 6g`, and a Mathlib-loaded REPL sits
around 4.3 GB before it elaborates anything. Checking a 600-line measure-theory file repeatedly
walks it into the cap: the symptom is not an error but a check that takes 10+ minutes at 40 % CPU
and then "Lean REPL died … respawning" in the logs, after which the backend silently retries on a
fresh REPL — paying the ~5 min olean load again, invisibly, so the *client* just sees one very slow
check. `docker stats --no-stream docker-lean-repl-1` separates "still elaborating" from "thrashing
at the cap" in one second; above ~5.5 GiB the next check is better spent after a restart.

**And measure the alternative before assuming the daemon wins.** Same file, same session:
10+ minutes in the memory-bound daemon, **15 seconds** under `lake build MathFin` in a fresh
`verify` container with the daemon down — the Lake replay of ~9000 unchanged modules costs a few
minutes and the changed leaf then elaborates unencumbered. The daemon's advantage is real but it is
*per-iteration latency on a warm, un-thrashed REPL*; once the REPL is near its cap, the canonical
build is both faster and the gate that actually counts (`lake build` has `autoImplicit false`, the
daemon has it true — an undeclared variable is invisible in the daemon and a hard error in the
build).


## Predictable ⟹ adapted is a trace statement (2026-08-28 batch)

### The obstruction to "predictable ⟹ adapted" is local, and dissolves when you localise

`⇑φ` strongly measurable for the **predictable** σ-algebra says nothing about `𝓕_b`-measurability:
predictable mixes every `𝓕_s`, `s` arbitrary. So `ω ↦ ∫_a^b φ(u,ω)² du` being `𝓕_b`-measurable
looks like it needs progressive measurability, which a bare `Lp` representative does not have —
and that is how it was recorded as a scope limit.

It is not the obstruction. Make the statement **local** and it becomes a one-line case analysis on
the generators:

> intersected with the band `(a,b] × Ω`, every predictable set is `Borel(ℝ≥0) ⊗ 𝓕_b`-measurable.

On a generator `(c,d] × F` with `F ∈ 𝓕_c`, the **left** endpoint decides: either `c ≤ b`, and
`F ∈ 𝓕_c ⊆ 𝓕_b`; or `c > b`, and `(c,d] ∩ (a,b] = ∅`. (The `{0} × F₀` generator meets the band
nowhere.) That asymmetry — the coefficient's index being the *left* endpoint — is exactly what
predictability buys, and it is the whole reason a predictable integrand has an adapted time
integral.

Then: clamp the integrand to the band (an indicator), which is now product-measurable at `b`, and
integrate the time variable out with `StronglyMeasurable.integral_prod_right'`.

### A trace σ-algebra is a `MeasurableSpace` — build it, and `generateFrom_le` replaces induction

The first draft proved the trace statement by `induction hS with | basic … | empty | compl | iUnion`
over `MeasurableSet[generateFrom C]`, which did not elaborate (the hypothesis needs to be in
`GenerateMeasurable` form, and the goal's σ-algebra kept being re-synthesised). The fix is to
notice that the *conclusion* defines a σ-algebra:

```lean
@[reducible] private def traceAlg … : MeasurableSpace (ℝ≥0 × Ω) where
  MeasurableSet' S := MeasurableSet[bandAlg …] (S ∩ band)
  measurableSet_empty := by rw [Set.empty_inter]; exact @MeasurableSet.empty _ (bandAlg …)
  measurableSet_compl S hS := by
    rw [show Sᶜ ∩ band = band \ (S ∩ band) from …]; exact (measurableSet_band …).diff hS
  measurableSet_iUnion f hf := by rw [Set.iUnion_inter]; exact MeasurableSet.iUnion hf
```

after which the statement is `predictable ≤ traceAlg`, i.e. `generateFrom_le` on the generators —
the repo's existing idiom, and no induction anywhere. Mark it `@[reducible]` or Lean rejects a
`def` of class type; mark it `noncomputable` if the σ-algebra mentions a noncomputable filtration.

### Instance-implicit measurability lemmas *synthesize*; they do not unify

Working at a non-ambient σ-algebra (here `𝓕 b` instead of `mΩ`) splits the measurability API in
two, and the split is invisible until it errors:

| shape | behaviour at a non-ambient instance |
|---|---|
| `MeasurableSet.empty`, `MeasurableSet.univ` | instance is **synthesized** from context → picks `mΩ`, fails. Write `@MeasurableSet.empty _ m`. |
| `.diff`, `.compl`, `.iUnion`, `.prod`, `.union` | instance is **unified** from the argument → correct automatically. |

Error to recognise: *"synthesized type class instance is not definitionally equal to expression
inferred by typing rules, synthesized `mΩ`, inferred `↑(natFiltration hBmeas) b`"*.

And `letI : MeasurableSpace Ω := m` is only usable where **no `μ`- or `mΩ`-typed term is in
scope** — otherwise every mention of `μ` re-elaborates at the new instance and mismatches. Factor
the one step that needs the swap into a standalone lemma over a bare type with a bare `m`:

```lean
private theorem measurable_integral_section {Ω' : Type*} (m : MeasurableSpace Ω')
    (g : ℝ≥0 × Ω' → ℝ) (hg : Measurable[@Prod.instMeasurableSpace ℝ≥0 Ω' _ m] g) :
    Measurable[m] fun ω ↦ ∫ u, g (u, ω) ∂timeMeasure := by
  letI : MeasurableSpace Ω' := m
  exact ((hg.comp measurable_swap).stronglyMeasurable.integral_prod_right').measurable
```

### `Adapted` here means `Measurable[𝓕 i]`; `StronglyAdapted` is the strong one

With Degenne's package in scope, `Adapted 𝓕 u` unfolds to `∀ i, Measurable[𝓕 i] (u i)` and
`StronglyAdapted` is the `StronglyMeasurable` variant (`DriftProcessPredictable` uses the latter).
`exact h.stronglyMeasurable` against an `Adapted` goal fails with an expected type of
`Measurable …`, which reads like a defeq problem and is not one.

### A patch script that asserts on every replacement is a foot-gun

`for old,new in reps: assert old in s; s = s.replace(...)` followed by one `open(p,'w')` at the end
discards **all** replacements when any single pattern is stale — and the next build then re-reports
the exact errors you just "fixed", which reads as the fix not working. Write the file regardless
and report the misses:

```python
missed = []
for old, new in reps:
    if old in s: s = s.replace(old, new, 1)
    else: missed.append(old[:60])
open(p, 'w').write(s)
print("MISSED:", missed or "none")
```

One stale pattern (a `·` bullet where the script expected spaces) cost a full build cycle before
this was changed.
