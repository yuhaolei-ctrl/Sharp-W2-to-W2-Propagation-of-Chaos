# Strict positivity propagates from one point to a later half-line slice

Continuity supplies a small positive patch. A straight tube carries that
patch to any prescribed interior point at a strictly later time. The tube
stays inside the spatial half-line. The result is derived from an explicit
barrier and weak comparison, not imported as a PDE axiom.

## Result

Public entry points include `positive_later_of_positive_point`.
