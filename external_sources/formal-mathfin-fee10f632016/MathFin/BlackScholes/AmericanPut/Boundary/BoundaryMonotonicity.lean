# Boundary monotonicity and speed at a hypothetical concave point

Price time-monotonicity forces the exercise boundary to be nonincreasing.
This yields a nonpositive derivative. If its second derivative were negative
at an interior time, its first derivative could not be zero there, because
that would be a local maximum of a nonpositive derivative.

This last observation is sufficient for the log-curvature contradiction. It
does not assert a strictly negative boundary speed at every positive time.

## Result

Public entry points include `boundary_antitoneOn`, `boundary_deriv_nonpos`, `boundary_deriv_neg_of_curvature_neg`, `zeroDividend_price_mono_time`.
